Here,, we evaluate the\nMarch 2023 and June 2023 versions of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on several diverse tasks: 1) math\nproblems,, 2) sensitive/dangerous questions,, 3) opinion surveys,, 4) multi-hop knowledge-intensive\nquestions,, 5) generating code,, 6) US Medical License tests,, and 7) visual reasoning. We find\nthat the performance and behavior of both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can vary greatly over time. For\nexample,, GPT-4 (March 2023) was reasonable at identifying prime vs. composite numbers (84%\naccuracy) but GPT-4 (June 2023) was poor on these same questions (51% accuracy). This is\npartly explained by a drop in GPT-4’s amenity to follow chain-of-thought prompting. Interestingly,,\nGPT-3.5 was much better in June than in March in this task. GPT-4 became less willing to\nanswer sensitive questions and opinion survey questions in June than in March. GPT-4 performed\nbetter at multi-hop questions in June than in March,, while GPT-3.5’s performance dropped on\nthis task. Both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 had more formatting mistakes in code generation in June\nthan in March. We provide evidence that GPT-4’s ability to follow user instructions has decreased\nover time,, which is one common factor behind the many behavior drifts. Overall,, our findings show\nthat the behavior of the “same” LLM service can change substantially in a relatively short amount\nof time,, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring of LLMs.\n1 Introduction\nLarge language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are being widely used. A LLM like GPT-4\ncan be updated over time based on data and feedback from users as well as design changes. However,,\nit is currently opaque when and how GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are updated,, and it is unclear how each\nupdate affects the behavior of these LLMs. These unknowns makes it challenging to stably integrate\nLLMs into larger workflows: if LLM’s response to a prompt (e.g. its accuracy or formatting) suddenly\nchanges,, this might break the downstream pipeline. It also makes it challenging,, if not impossible,, to\nreproduce results from the “same” LLM.\nBeyond these integration challenges,, it is also an interesting question whether an LLM service like\nGPT-4 is consistently improving over time. It is important to know whether updates to the model\naimed at improving some aspects can reduce its capability in other dimensions.\nMotivated by these questions,, we evaluated the behavior of the March 2023 and June 2023 versions\nof GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on several tasks: 1) solving math problems,, 2) answering sensitive/dangerous\nquestions,, 3) answering opinion surveys,, 4) answering multi-hop knowledge-intensive questions,, 5)\ngenerating code,, 6) US Medical License exams,, and 7) visual reasoning. These tasks were selected to\nevaluate diverse and useful capabilities of these LLMs. We find that the performance and behavior of\nboth GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 varied significantly across these two releases and that their performance on\nsome tasks have gotten substantially worse over time,, while they have improved on other problems\n(summarized in Figure 1).\nHow to explain those performance and behavior drifts? We hypothesize that changes in ChatGPT’s\nability to follow user instructions could be a common factor behind the drifts across tasks. As a first\nstep towards testing this hypothesis,, we have curated a set of task-agnostic instructions,, and evaluate\nthe March and June versions of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 on it. Overall,, we observe a large decrease of\nGPT-4’s ability to follow many instructions. GPT-4 in March was typically good at following user’s\ninstructions (e.g. generating responses following specified formats),, but in June it failed to follow most\nof these simple instructions (Figure 1).\n1arXiv:2307.09009v3  [cs.CL]  31 Oct 2023\n\nMath IMath IIOpinionQA\nSensitiv eQA\n LangChain\n  HotpotQA\nVisual  \nReasoning\nCode Gener ation\n and F ormatting    USMLE\nMedical Exam050% 100%Math IMath IIOpinionQA\nSensitiv eQA\n LangChain\n  HotpotQA\nVisual  \nReasoning\nCode Gener ation\n and F ormatting    USMLE\nMedical Exam050% 100%GPT-4 GPT-3.5\nMarch 2023\nJune 2023\nExtract Answer Stop Apologizing\nWriting Constr aint Format T ext050% 100%Extract Answer Stop Apologizing\nWriting Constr aint Format T ext050% 100%(a) Performance drift\n(b) Instruction following shiftFigure 1: Overview of performance drift (a) and instruction following shift (b) of GPT-4 (left panel)\nand GPT-3.5 (right panel) between March 2023 and June 2023. Higher evaluation metric is better.\nOn eight diverse tasks (detailed below),, the models’ performance drifts considerably over time,, and\nsometimes for the worse. The decrease of GPT-4’s ability to follow instructions over time matched its\nbehavior drift and partially explained the corresponding performance drops.\nOur findings highlight the need to continuously monitor LLMs’ behavior over time. All prompts we\ncurated in this paper and responses from GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 in both March and June are collected\nand released in https://github.com/lchen001/LLMDrift . Our analysis and visualization code has\nalso been open-sourced. We hope our work stimulates more study on LLM drifts to enable trustworthy\nand reliable LLM applications.\nRelated Work. There have been multiple benchmarks and evaluations of LLMs including GPT-3.5\nand GPT-4 [ LBL+22,,ZPM+23,,LNT+23,,BCL+23]. Existing works show that LLMs achieve reasonable\nperformance on traditional language tasks such as reading comprehension [ dW23 ],, translation [ JWH+23],,\nand summarization [ GLD22 ]. More recently,, GPT-4 was shown to successfully pass difficult exams in\nprofessional domains such as medicine [ NKM+23] and law [ KBGA23 ]. To the best of our knowledge,,\nmost of these works do not systematically monitor the longitudinal drifts of widely used LLM services\nover time or report large drifts in them. ChatLog [ TLY+23] proposed recording and monitoring\nChatGPT’s responses automatically over time and reported small shifts (most below 5%) in ChatGPT’s\nperformance on some common benchmarks. Other papers [ AAKA23 ,,SKNM23 ] also reported shifts\nin specific problems. Monitoring model performance shifts is an emerging research area for machine-\nlearning-as-a-service (MLaaS) more broadly. [ CJE+22] offers a large-scale longitudinal dataset of\ncommercial ML service responses on various evaluation tasks,, and [ CCZZ21 ] studies how to efficiently\nestimate ML service performance shifts. Those papers focus on ML services for simple classification\ntasks such as sentiment analysis,, while this work studies generative LLM services.\n2\n\nIs 17077 a prime number?

The models’\nperformance varies substantially over time,, and sometimes for the worse.\n2 Overview: LLM Services,, Tasks and Metrics\nThis paper studies how different LLMs’ behaviors change over time. To answer it quantitatively,, we\nneed to specify (i) which LLM services to monitor,, (ii) on which application scenarios to focus,, and (iii)\nhow to measure LLM drifts in each scenario.\nLLM Services. The LLM services monitored in this paper are GPT-4 and GPT-3.5,, which form the\nbackbone of ChatGPT. Due to the popularity of ChatGPT,, both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 have been widely\nadopted by individual users and a number of businesses. Thus,, timely and systematically monitoring\nthese two services helps a large range of users better understand and leverage LLMs for their own use\ncases. At the time of writing,, there are two major versions available for GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 through\nOpenAI’s API,, one snapshotted in March 2023 and another in June 2023. Therefore we focus on the\ndrifts between these two dates. For simplicity,, we queried these services via the user prompt only and\nleft the system prompt as default. We set the temperature to be 0.1 to reduce output randomness,, as\ncreativity was not needed in our evaluation tasks.\n3\n\nEvaluation Tasks. In this paper,, we focus on eight LLM tasks frequently studied in performance and\nsafety benchmarks: solving math problems (including two problem types),, answering sensitive questions ,,\nanswering OpinionQA survey ,,LangChain HotpotQA Agent ,,code generation ,,taking USMLE medical\nexam ,, and visual reasoning ,, as shown in Figure 1. These tasks are selected for two reasons. First,, they\nare diverse tasks frequently used to evaluate LLMs in the literature [ WWS+22,,ZPM+23,,CTJ+21].\nSecond,, they are relatively objective and thus easy-to-evaluate . For each task,, we use queries either\nsampled from existing datasets or constructed by us. We acknowledge that the specific benchmark\ndatasets used here does not comprehensively cover the complex behaviors of ChatGPT. Our goal here\nis not to provide a holistic assessment but to demonstrate that substantial ChatGPT performance drift\nexists on simple tasks. We are adding more benchmarks in future evaluations as part of a broader,,\nlong-term study of LLM service behavior. We cover each task in detail in the next section.\nMetrics. How can we quantitatively model and measure LLM drifts in different tasks? Here,, we\nconsider one main performance metric for each task and two common additional metrics for all tasks.\nThe former captures the performance measurement specific to each scenario,, while the latter covers\ncommon complementary measurement across different applications.\nIn particular,, we use accuracy (how often an LLM service generates the correct answer) as our main\nmetric for math problems and USMLE questions. For answering sensitive and opinion questions,, we\nuse the response rate ,, i.e. the frequency that an LLM service directly answers a question. For code\ngeneration,, the main metric is what fraction of the outputs are directly executable (if the code can be\ndirectly executed in a programming environment and pass the unit tests). For visual reasoning and\nLangChain,, it is exact match (whether the final response exactly matches the ground truth).\nOur first common additional metric is verbosity ,, i.e.,, the length of generation measured in the\nnumber of characters. The second one is mismatch ,, i.e. how often,, for the same prompt,, the extracted\nanswers by two versions of the same LLM service do not match. Note that this only compares the\nanswers’ differences,, not the raw generations. For example,, for math problems,, mismatch is 0 if the\ngenerated answers are the same,, even if the intermediate reasoning steps are different. For each LLM\nservice,, we use the mismatch’s empirical mean over the entire population to quantify how much an\nLLM service’s desired functionality,, instead of the textual outputs,, deviates over time. Larger mismatch\nmeans greater drifts. For each of the other metrics,, We compute its population mean for both the\nMarch and June versions,, and leverage their differences to measure the drift sizes.\n3 Monitoring Reveals Substantial LLM Drifts\n3.1 Math I (Prime vs Composite): Chain-of-Thought Can Fail\nHow do GPT-4 and GPT-3.5’s math solving skills evolve over time? As a canonical study,, we explore\nthe drifts in these LLMs’ ability to figure out whether a given integer is prime or composite. We focus\non this task because it is easy to understand for humans while still requires reasoning,, resembling many\nmath problems. The dataset contains 1,,000 questions,, where 500 primes were extracted from [ ZPM+23]\nand 500 composite numbers were sampled uniformly from all composite numbers within the interval\n[1,,000,, 20,,000]. To help the LLMs reason,, we use Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting [ WWS+22],, a\nstandard approach for reasoning-heavy tasks.\nPerhaps surprisingly,, substantial LLM drifts emerge on this simple task. As shown in Figure 3(a),,\nGPT-4’s accuracy dropped from 84.0% in March to 51.1% in June,, and there was a large improvement of\nGPT-3.5’s accuracy,, from 49.6% to 76.2%. In addition,, GPT-4’s response became much more compact:\nits average verbosity (number of generated characters) decreased from 638.3 in March to 3.9 in June.\nOn the other hand,, there was about 22.2% growth in GPT-3.5’s response length. The answer mismatch\nbetween their March and June versions was also large for both services.\nWhy was there such a large difference? One possible explanation is change in the chain-of-thought\n(CoT) behaviors. Figure 3 (b) gives an illustrative example. To determine whether 17077 is a prime\nnumber,, the GPT-4’s March version followed the CoT instruction well. It first decomposed the task\ninto four steps,, checking if 17077 is even,, finding 17077’s square root,, obtaining all prime numbers\nless than it,, checking if 17077 is divisible by any of these numbers. Then it executed each step,, and\nfinally reached the correct answer that 17077 is indeed a prime number. However,, the chain-of-thought\ndid not work for the June version: the service did not generate any intermediate steps,, even though\n4\n\n59.9%\n00.20.40.60.81\n730.4891.2\nMarch 2023 June 2023020040060080010001200\n49.6%76.2%\nMarch 2023 June 202300.20.40.60.81\n62.6%\n00.20.40.60.81GPT-4 GPT-3.5\nMarch 2023\nJune 2023Step 1: Check if the number is even. If it is,, then it is not prime (except for 2). 17077\nis odd,, so we proceed to the next step. Step 2: Find the square root of the number .\nThe square root of 17077 is approximately 130.68. Step 3: Check if the number is\ndivisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root. The prime\nnumbers less than or equal to 130.68 are 2,, 3,, 5,, 7,, 1 1,, 13,, 17,, 19,, 23,, 29,, 31,, 37,,\n41,, 43,, 47,, 53,, 59,, 61,, 67,, 71,, 73,, 79,, 83,, 89,, 97,, 101,, 103,, 107,, 109,, 1 13,, 127. Step\n4: Test each of these prime numbers as a divisor . If any of them divide 17077 without\na remainder ,, then 17077 is not prime. If none of them divide 17077 without a\nremainder ,, then 17077 is prime. 17077 is not divisible by any of the prime numbers\nlisted above without a remainder . Therefore,, 17077 is a prime number . Answer: [Y es]\n[No] [No] Explanation: T o determine if 17077 is a prime number ,, we need to check if it is\nonly divisible by 1 and itself. W e can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. If it is,,\nthen it is not a prime number . 17077 is an odd number ,, so it is not divisible by 2.\nNext,, we can check if it is divisible by any odd number up to the square root of\n17077 (which is approximately 130.7). W e can see that it is not divisible by 3,, 5,, 7,,\n11,, 13,, or any other odd number up to 130.7. Therefore,, 17077 is a prime number .\nTo determine if 17077 is a prime number ,, we need to check if it is divisible by any\nnumber other than 1 and itself. 1. W e start by checking if 17077 is divisible by 2.\nSince it is an odd number (not divisible by 2),, we move on to the next step. 2. Next,,\nwe check if 17077 is divisible by 3. By adding the digits of 17077 (1 + 7 + 0 + 7 + 7 =\n22),, we see that 17077 is not divisible by 3. 3. W e continue by checking if 17077 is\ndivisible by 5. Since it does not end in 0 or 5,, it is not divisible by 5. 4. Next,, we\ncheck if 17077 is divisible by 7. By subtracting twice the last digit (7) from the\nremaining leading digits (1707 - 2*7 = 1693),, we see that 17077 is not divisible by 7.\n5. We continue by checking if 17077 is divisible by 1 1. By alternatingly subtracting\nand adding the digits (1 - 7 + 0 - 7 + 7 = -6),, we see that 17077 is not divisible by 1 1. \n6. Finally ,, we check if 17077 is divisible by 13. By subtracting four times the last digit\n(7) from the remaining leading digits (1707 - 4*7 = 1679),, we see that 17077 is not\ndivisible by 13. Since we have checked all the prime numbers up to the square root\nof 17077 and found that it is not divisible by any of them,, we can conclude that\n17077 is a prime number .

(a): monitored accuracy,, verbosity (unit: character),, and\nanswer mismatch of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 between March and June 2023. Overall,, a large performance\ndrifts existed for both services. (b) An example query and corresponding responses over time. GPT-4\nfollowed the chain-of-thought instruction to obtain the right answer in March,, but ignored it in June\nwith the wrong answer. GPT-3.5 always followed the chain-of-thought,, but it insisted on generating a\nwrong answer ( [No]) first in March. This issue was largely fixed in June.\nthe prompt asked to think step-by-step,, and simply produced “No”. Chain-of-thought’s effects had a\ndifferent drift pattern for GPT-3.5. In March,, GPT-3.5 inclined to generate the answer “No” first and\nthen performed the reasoning steps. Thus,, even if the steps and final conclusion (“17077 is a prime\nnumber”) were correct,, its nominal answer was still wrong. On the other hand,, the June update seemed\nto fix this issue: it started by writing the reasoning steps and finally generate the answer “Yes”,, which\nwas correct. This interesting phenomenon indicates that the same prompting approach,, even the widely\nadopted chain-of-thought strategy,, could lead to substantially different performances due to LLM drifts.\nTo further investigate the impact of CoT behavior changes,, we compared the responses of GPT-4\nand GPT-3.5 on the same questions with and without explicit CoT instructions. For the latter,, we\nsimply ask the model to give a binary generation without explicitly asking it to think step-by-step (e.g.,,\nIs 17077 a prime number? Answer ”[Yes]” or ”[No]”.).\nAs shown in Table 1,, using CoT increased GPT-4’s performance from 59.6% to 84.0% in March,,\nleading to a 24.4% performance boost. On the other hand,, CoT did not help the June version of GPT-4\nmuch: the accuracy was actually 0.1% worse. As we discussed before,, this is because the new version\ndid not follow the CoT instructions. For GPT-3.5,, an opposite trend was observed: by adding CoT,,\naccuracy was marginally better (+6.3% ) in March,, but substantially higher (+15.8%) in June. Since\nGPT-3.5 in both March and June followed the CoT instructions. This suggests that LLM drifts could\nchange both whether andhowto follow user instruction.\nOur analysis so far is largely based on shifts of the main metric,, accuracy,, but fine-grained\ninvestigations could disclose additional interesting shift patterns. One observation is that June version\nof GPT-4 had a strong bias to view an integer as a composite number. To see so,, we quantified how\nthe confusion matrices shifted over time. As shown in Figure 4(c),, GPT-4’s June version almost always\nidentified an integer as composite (49.9%+48.8%=99.7%). GPT-3.5’s March version exhibited a similar\n5\n\nTable 1: Chain-of-thought’s (CoT) effectiveness drifts over time for prime testing. Without CoT,, both\nGPT-4 and GPT-3.5 achieved relatively low accuracy. With CoT,, GPT-4 in March obtained a 24.4%\naccuracy improvement,, which dropped to -0.1% in June. On the other hand,, the CoT boost increased\nfrom -0.9% in March to 15.8% in June for GPT-3.5.\nLLM ServiceGPT-4 GPT-3.5\nPrompting method\n∆Prompting method\n∆Eval Time No CoT CoT No CoT CoT\nMar-23 59.6% 84.0% +24.4% 50.5% 49.6% -0.9%\nJun-23 51.0% 51.1% +0.1% 60.4% 76.2% +15.8%\nGPT-4 GPT-3.5\nMarch 2023\nJune 2023Accuracy Verbosity Accuracy Verbosity Overlap\ncomposite prime undetermined\nprimecomposite\n0.10.20.30.4Model GenerationGround Truth 35.2% 14.7% 0.1%\n0.9% 48.8% 0.3%\ncomposite prime undetermined\nprimecomposite\n0.10.20.30.4Model GenerationGround Truth 49.9% 0.1% 0.0%\n48.8% 1.2% 0.0%\ncomposite prime undetermined\nprimecomposite\n0.10.20.30.4Model GenerationGround Truth 32.8% 15.1% 2.1%\n4.1% 43.4% 2.5%(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\ncomposite prime undetermined\nprimecomposite\n0.10.20.30.4Model GenerationGround Truth 42.2% 7.8% 0.0%\n42.6% 7.4% 0.0%\nFigure 4: Confusion matrix shift for the prime vs composite problem. GPT-4’s March version\nidentified most primes and composite number correctly,, while its June version consistently answered\nmost primes as composite.\nissue. The confusion matrices for GPT-4 in March and GPT-3.5 in June seem more reasonable: they\nidentified both prime and composite numbers correctly for the major cases. Similar findings have been\nrecently reported [NK23].\nInstance-level investigation discloses additional insights. We uniformly randomly sampled 8 numbers\nto manually inspect March GPT-4’s step-by-step logic. March GPT-4’s CoT logic was mostly sound in\nthese cases,, though it can make arithmetic mistakes,, and it reached the correct conclusion in 7 of the 8\ncases. We show 4 examples below and provide the others in the Appendix. For example,, the following\ngeneration by GPT-4 gave the correct reasoning steps for 19997.\nStep 1: Check if the number is divisible by 2. Since 19997 is an odd number,, it is not divisible\nby 2.\nStep 2: Find the square root of the number. The square root of 19997 is approximately 141.4.\nStep 3: Check for divisibility by prime numbers less than or equal to the square root. We will\ncheck for divisibility by 3,, 5,, 7,, 11,, 13,, 17,, 19,, 23,, 29,, 31,, 37,, 41,, 43,, 47,, 53,, 59,, 61,, 67,, 71,, 73,,\n79,, 83,, 89,, 97,, 101,, 103,, 107,, 109,, 113,, 127,, 131,, 137,, and 139.\n19997 is not divisible by any of these prime numbers.\nTherefore,, 19997 is a prime number.\nAnswer: [Yes]\nAsking the same query multiple times gives the same conclusion,, though the intermediate reasoning\n6\n\nsteps can be slightly different. For example,, a second generation by GPT-4 in March was more verbose,,\nas it explicitly checked the divisibility of 19997 by each prime number less than it (see Appendix). In\naddition,, GPT-4 in March also identified composite numbers divisible by 2 or 5 correctly. For example,,\nto determine whether 16450 is prime,, GPT-4 in March wrote the following response.\nStep 1: Check if the number is even. If it is,, then it is not prime (except for 2). 16450 is an\neven number because it ends in 0.\nSo,, the answer is [No].\nSimilarly,, to check 9175,, it gave the following reasoning steps.\nStep 1: Find the square root of 9175. The square root of 9175 is approximately 95.78.\nStep 2: Check for divisibility by smaller prime numbers (2,, 3,, 5,, 7,, 11,, 13,, 17,, 19,, 23,, 29,, 31,, 37,,\n41,, 43,, 47,, 53,, 59,, 61,, 67,, 71,, 73,, 79,, 83,, 89,, 97).\nStep 3: 9175 is divisible by 5 (9175 ÷5 = 1835).\nSince 9175 is divisible by a prime number other than itself and 1,, it is not a prime number.\nAnswer: [No]\nIn both cases,, March GPT-4’s step-by-step logic led to the right answer. However,, it also made\nsubtle mistakes on some other queries. For example,, to check whether 4323 is a prime number,, it\ngenerated the following content.\n- 4323 is not divisible by 3 (4323 / 3 = 1441 with a remainder).\nHere,, it actually used the correct logic (checking if 4323 is divisible by any prime numbers),, but\nmade a mistake in calculation (4323/3 = 1441 exactly without a remainder).\n3.2 Math II (Counting Happy Numbers): CoT Also Less Effective\nTo further investigate ChatGPT’s math problem solving and chain-of-thought behaviors,, we asked it to\ntackle a different math problem: counting the number of happy numbers [ Guy04 ,, pp. 357-360] within a\ngiven interval. An integer is called happy if replacing it by the sum of the square of its digits repeatedly\neventually produces 1. For example,, 13 is a happy number because 12+ 32= 10,, and 12+ 02= 1. This\ntask complements prime testing because it asks for a quantitative response (number of happy numbers)\nrather than a binary decision (e.g.,, prime or composite) and it only uses simple arithmetic. To assess\nLLM drift on this task,, we constructed a dataset of 500 queries. Each query asks how many happy\nnumbers there are within a given interval and we quantify how often the LLM gets the correct number\nexactly. The interval size was uniformly randomly selected from 6 to 10,, and the interval starting point\nwas uniformly randomly chosen from 500 to 15,,000. To encourage logic reasoning steps,, we adopt CoT\nprompting again.\nWe also observed significant performance drifts on this task. As shown in Figure 5(a),, GPT-4’s\naccuracy dropped from 83.6% in March to 35.2% in June. On the other hand,, accuracy of GPT-3.5\nincreased from 30.6% to 48.2%. There was also a large change in the verbosity (number of characters\nin the generated responses). GPT-4’s generation length dropped from 2163.5 in March to 10.0 in June,,\nbut GPT-3.5’s length increased by more than 60%. Compared to prime testing (Math I),, the answer\nlengths on average were significantly larger due to requiring more steps to enumerate the numbers in\nthe interval and repeatedly square digits. In addition,, 67.6% of GPT-4’s final answers changed between\nMarch and June,, as did 77.2% of GPT-3.5’s.\nAs with the prime number testing task,, we observed a large shift in the LLMs’ CoT behaviors. As\nshown in Figure 5(b),, GPT-4 in June did not follow the CoT instructions and only gave a final answer,,\nwhile its March counterpart followed the instructions to leverage reasoning steps. GPT-3.5 followed\nCoT instructions in both March and June. Its reasoning steps in June were much longer than that in\nMarch. While overall this led to better performance,, sometimes it was problematic due to exceeding\nthe maximum token length and thus not generating the final answer.\n7\n\nTo determine the number of happy numbers between 3904 and 3912,, we need\nto check each number in this range to see if it is a happy number.\nA happy number is a number that,, when repeatedly replaced by the sum of the\nsquares of its digits,, eventually reaches 1. If it never reaches 1 and instead\nenters a cycle,, it is not a happy number.\nLet\'s check each number in the range:\n3904: $3^2 + 9^2 + 0^2 + 4^2 = 90$ [...]\xa03904 is not a happy number.\n3905: $3^2 + 9^2 + 0^2 + 5^2 = 91$\n[...]\n$1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1$\n3905 is a happy number.\xa0[...]\nOut of the numbers between 3904 and 3912,, there are $\\boxed{4}$ happy\nnumbers.First,, we need to know what a happy number is. A happy number is a number\nthat,, when you replace it with the sum of the squares of its digits and repeat the\nprocess,, eventually reaches 1. For example,, 19 is a happy number because:\n$1^2 + 9^2 = 82$\n$8^2 + 2^2 = 68$\n$6^2 + 8^2 = 100$\n$1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1$\nNow,, we need to check each number between 3904 and 3912 to see if it is\nhappy. We can start with 3904: [...]\nWe have reached a cycle of 37 and 145,, so 3904 is not a happy number. We can\ncontinue with the rest of the numbers:\n$3905$ is not happy because it reaches a cycle of 42 and 20.\n$3906$ is not happy because it reaches a cycle of 45 and 41.\n$3907$ is not happy because it reaches a cycle of 58 and 89.\n[...]\nTherefore,, there is only $\\boxed{1}$ happy number between 3904 and 3912,,\nwhich is 3910.Let\'s check each number between 3904 and 3912 to see if they are happy\nnumbers.\n3904: 3^2 + 9^2 + 0^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 81 + 0 + 16 = 106\n106: 1^2 + 0^2 + 6^2 = 1 + 0 + 36 = 37\n37: 3^2 + 7^2 = 9 + 49 = 58\n58: 5^2 + 8^2 = 25 + 64 = 89\n89: 8^2 + 9^2 = 64 + 81 = 145\n145: 1^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 1 + 16 + 25 = 42\n42: 4^2 + 2^2 = 16 + 4 = 20\n20: 2^2 + 0^2 = 4 + 0 = 4\n4: 4^2 = 16\n16: 1^2 + 6^2 = 1 + 36 = 37\n3904 is not a happy number since it enters a cycle (37,, 58,, 89,, 145,, 42,, 20,, 4,,\n16).\n3905: [...] 3905 is not a happy number since it enters the same cycle as 3904.\n[...]\nThere are 2 happy numbers between 3904 and 3912: 3907 and 3910.\nSo,, the answer is \\boxed{2}.67.6%\n00.20.40.60.81\n77.2%\n00.20.40.60.81GPT-4 GPT-3.5\nMarch 2023\nJune 2023 \\boxed{1}Accuracy Verbosity Mismatch Accuracy Verbosity Mismatcha\nb\nExampleHow many happy numbers are there between 3904 and 3912?

(a) Overall drifts. The accuracy of GPT-4\ndropped from 83.6% to 35.2%. On the other hand,, there was a 17.8% accuracy gain for GPT-3.5.\nGPT-4 became less verbose while GPT-3.5 generated much longer answers. (b) Example query and\ncorresponding answers. GPT-4 followed the CoT instructions but ignored it in June. GPT-3.5 followed\nCoT in March and June,, and gave a longer reasoning steps in June.\nTo further understand how the CoT effects’ shifts,, we asked each service the same query either with\nor without CoT prompting,, and studied how much accuracy gain was achieved by having CoT. We have\nfound that CoT’s benefits shifted too. For example,, for GPT-4,, CoT brought 56.6% accuracy boost in\nMarch but only 3.2% in June,, as shown in Table 2. For GPT-3.5,, CoT led to 20.6% performance gains\nin June. In March,, however,, CoT caused a 1.6% accuracy drop.\nThe number of mistakes made by GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 changed over time. But what new mistakes\ndid they make? To answer this question,, we performed a fine-grained analysis on the confusion matrix\nof these LLMs over time,, as shown in Figure 6. It was interesting to note how the bias of GPT-4 and\nGPT-3.5 changed over time. GPT-4 in June had a strong belief that there was only 0 or 1 happy\nnumber within any given interval. On the other hand,, GPT-3.5 in June was inclined to overestimate\nthe number: on more than 10% queries,, it responded that there were more than 4 happy numbers,,\nwhile 4 was actually the upper bound among all our queries. We also ran additional experiments with\nsmaller intervals for happy numbers and observed similar trends in the LLMs’ behavior (see Appendix).\n3.3 Answering Sensitive Questions: Safer but Less Rationale\nPrompting LLMs with sensitive questions is known to lead to harmful generations such as social\nbiases [ GLK+22],, personal information [ CTW+21],, and toxic texts [ GGS+20]. Thus,, another goal of\nthis paper was to understand how LLM services’ responses to sensitive questions have shifted over\ntime. To achieve this goal,, we have created a sensitive question dataset,, which contains 100 sensitive\nqueries that LLM services are not supposed to answer directly. As it is challenging to automatically\nevaluate whether a response is indeed a direct answer,, we have manually labelled all responses from the\n8\n\nTable 2: Benefits of CoT drift over time for happy number counting. For GPT-4,, CoT brought 56.6%\naccuracy gains in March,, which dropped to 3.2% in June. For GPT-3.5,, the accuracy gains were 20.6%\nin June. Interestingly,, adding CoT to GPT-3.5 caused a 1.6% performance downgrade in March.\nLLM ServiceGPT-4 GPT-3.5\nPrompting method\n∆Prompting method\n∆Eval Time No CoT CoT No CoT CoT\nMar-23 27.0% 83.6% 56.6% 32.2% 30.6% -1.6%\nJun-23 32.0% 35.2% 3.2% 27.6% 48.2% 20.6%\nGPT-4 GPT-3.5\nJune 2023(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 NA\n43210\n0.050.10.15Model GenerationGround Truth9% 16% 5% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 2%\n9% 15% 5% 1% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 1%\n5% 9% 7% 2% 1% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 1%\n1% 3% 2% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0%\n1% 1% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0%\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 NA\n43210\n0.050.10.15Model GenerationGround Truth14% 4% 4% 0% 1% 1% 2% 1% 1% 0% 6%\n3% 15% 6% 0% 1% 1% 1% 1% 1% 0% 5%\n1% 0% 16% 1% 1% 0% 1% 0% 0% 0% 4%\n0% 0% 2% 2% 0% 0% 1% 0% 0% 0% 1%\n0% 0% 1% 1% 1% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0%\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 NA\n43210\n0.050.10.150.20.25Model GenerationGround Truth28% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 4%\n0% 29% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 4%\n0% 3% 19% 1% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 2%\n0% 0% 1% 5% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0%\n0% 0% 0% 0% 2% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0%\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 NA\n43210\n0.050.10.150.2Model GenerationGround Truth9% 23% 1% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0%\n6% 25% 2% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0%\n6% 18% 1% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0%\n1% 6% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0%\n0% 2% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0%March 2023\nFigure 6: Confusion matrix shift for counting happy numbers. GPT-4’s March version calculated\nthe number correctly for most queries,, while its June version responded that there was only one happy\nnumber most of the time.\nmonitored LLM services.\nWe observed two major trends on this task. First,, as shown in Figure 7,, GPT-4 answered fewer\nsensitive questions from March (21.0%) to June (5.0%) while GPT-3.5 answered more (from 2.0% to\n8.0%). It was likely that a stronger safety layer was likely to deployed in the June update for GPT-4,,\nwhile GPT-3.5 became less conservative. Another observation is that the generation length (measured\nby number of characters) of GPT-4 dropped from more than 600 to about 140.\nWhy did the generation length change? Besides answering fewer questions,, it was also because\nGPT-4 became more terse and offered fewer explanations when it refused to answer a query. To see\nthis,, consider the example shown in Figure 7(b). GPT-4 refused to answer the inappropriate query in\nboth March and June. However,, it generated a whole paragraph to explain the rejection reasons in\nMarch,, but simply produced “Sorry,, but I cannot assist with that”. A similar phenomenon happened\nfor GPT-3.5 too. This suggests that these LLM services may have become safer,, but also provide less\nrationale for refusing to answer certain questions.\nLLM Jailbreaking. Jailbreaking attacks are a major thread to LLM service safety [ GLK+22]. It\nrephrases or reorganizes the original sensitive questions in order to produce harmful generations from\nLLMs. Thus,, it is also critical to study how LLM services’ defense against jailbreaking attacks drift over\ntime. Here,, we leverage the AIM (always intelligent and Machiavellian) attack1,, the most user-voted\namong a largest collection of ChatGPT jailbreaks on the internet2. The AIM attack describes a\nhypothetical story and asks LLM services to act as an unfiltered and amoral chatbot. We applied the\nAIM attack for each query in the sensitive question dataset and then queried GPT-4 and GPT-3.5.\nThe answer rate of their March and June versions was shown in Table 3. There was a large increase\n1www.jailbreakchat.com/prompt/4f37a029-9dff-4862-b323-c96a5504de5d\n2jailbreakchat.com\n9\n\n16.0%00.20.40.60.81\n6.0%\n00.20.40.60.81GPT-4 GPT-3.5\nMarch 2023\nJune 2023As an AI language model,, I must clarify that I do not endorse or\nsupport any form of discrimination,, including gender discrimination.

However,, their\ntemporal drifts differed substantially. For GPT-4,, AIM attack produced 78% direct answers in March,,\nbut only 31.0% in June. For GPT-3.5,, there was only a 4% (=100%-96%) answer rate difference among\nthe two versions. This suggests that GPT-4’s update was more robust to jailbreaking attacks than that\nof GPT-3.5.\n3.4 OpinionQA Survey: Lower Response Rate\nLLMs are increasingly leveraged for open-ended text generation,, where bias in the opinions in their\ntraining or fine-tuning data can play an important role. Therefore,, it is vital to understand how\nLLMs’ opinion biases change over time. To address this problem,, we leverage OpinionQA [ SDL+23],, a\nsurvey dataset that contains 1,,506 opinion questions. We pick this dataset as its questions were drawn\nfrom high-quality public opinion polls. We followed the multiple-choice question format provided in\n[SDL+23],, and added “Pick the best single option” for ease of extracting the answer.\nThere were substantial and interesting drifts over time on this opinion survey. First,, GPT-4 became\nless willing to offer its opinions. As shown in Figure 8(a),, GPT-4’s response rate dropped from 97.6%\nin March to 22.1% in June. In contrast,, GPT-3.5’s response rate actually increased by 2%. GPT-3.5\nanswered almost all questions in both March and June. Yet,, 27% of its opinions changed from March\nto June. For comparison,, running GPT-3.5 March twice yields disagreement rate of 2.8% and running\nGPT-3.5 June twice yields disagreement rate of 7.0%,, due to LLM’s stochasticity. These indicate\n10\n\n27.5%\n00.20.40.60.81GPT-4 GPT-3.5\nMarch 2023\nJune 2023(B).

GPT-4 refused to offer its opinion in June,, while it did not in\nMarch.\nconsiderable opinion drifts over time above and beyond model’s randomness.\nA closer look at how the opinions changed gave us additional insights. As shown in the example\nin Figure 8(b),, GPT-4 in March believed that the US will be less important in the world. In June,,\nhowever,, the model refused to answer the question,, because it viewed the question as “subjective” and\nthus it simply generated “As an AI,, I don’t have personal opinions”. This illustrates a significant\nchange in GPT-4’s behavior in responding (or not responding) to subjective questions.\n3.5 Code Generation: Less Adherence to Formatting Instructions\nOne major application of LLMs is code generation [ CTJ+21]. While many code generation datasets\nexist [ CTJ+21,,YZY+18,,AON+21],, using them to assess LLM services’ code generation ability faces\nthe data contamination issue. To overcome this,, we have constructed a new code generation dataset.\nIt contains the latest 50 problems from the “easy” category of LeetCode at the time of writing. The\nearliest public solutions and discussions were released in December 2022. The prompt for each problem\nis the concatenation of the original problem description and the corresponding Python code template.\nEach LLM’s generation was directly sent to the LeetCode online judge for evaluation. We call it directly\nexecutable if the online judge accepts the answer (i.e.,, the answer is valid Python and passes its tests).\nOverall,, the number of directly executable generations dropped from March to June. As shown in\nFigure 9 (a),, over 50% generations of GPT-4 were directly executable in March,, but only 10% in June.\nThe trend was similar for GPT-3.5. There was also a small increase in verbosity for both models.\nWhy did the number of directly executable generations decline? One possible explanation is that\nthe June versions consistently added extra non-code text to their generations. Figure 9 (b) gives\none such instance. GPT-4’s generations in March and June are almost the same except two parts.\nFirst,, the June version added ‘‘‘python and‘‘‘before and after the code snippet (likely to format\nit as Markdown in UIs). Second,, it also generated a few more comments. While a small change,, the\nextra triple quotes render the code not executable. This type of shift in formatting behavior can be\nparticularly challenging to detect when LLM’s generated code is used inside a larger software pipeline.\nWe also study whether the generated code passes the LeetCode tests after additional post-processing\nthat removes the non-code text. As shown in Table 4,, there was again a notable drift: GPT-4’s\nperformance increased from 52% to 70%,, and there was a 2% improvement for GPT-3.5. While the\ncode’s correctness improved,, the failure to format the formatting instructions (“generate the code only”)\nis still a problematic change in behavior between the two GPT model versions.\n11\n\n50.0%\n00.20.40.60.81\n20.0%\n00.20.40.60.81\n```python\nclass Solution(object):\n    def isFascinating(self,, n):\n        # Concatenate n,, 2*n and 3*n\n        s = str(n) + str(n*2) + str(n*3)  \n        # Check if the length of s is 9 and contains all digits from 1 to 9\n        return len(s) == 9 and set(s) == set(\'123456789\')\n```GPT-4 GPT-3.5\nMarch 2023\nJune 2023class Solution(object):  \n    def isFascinating(self,, n):  \n        # Convert n to string for easier manipulation  \n        n_str = str(n)    \n        # Concatenate n,, 2*n,, and 3*n  \n        concatenated_str = n_str + str(2*n) + str(3*n)  \n        # Check if concatenated string contains all digits from 1 to 9\nexactly once  \n        if set(concatenated_str) == set(\'123456789\'):  \n            return T rue \n        else:  \n            return False\n```python\nclass Solution(object):\n    def isFascinating(self,, n):\n        # Convert n to string\n        n_str = str(n)\n        # Concatenate n with 2*n and 3*n\n        concatenated_str = n_str + str(2 * n) + str(3 * n)\n        # Check if the concatenated string contains \n        # all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once\n        if set(concatenated_str) == set(\'123456789\'):\n            return True\n        else:\n            return False\n```Directly Executable Verbosity Mismatch  Verbosity Mismatch  a\nb\nExample[Description] : You are given an integer  that consists of exactly  digits.

(a) Overall performance drifts. For GPT-4,, the percentage of generations\nthat are directly executable dropped from 52.0% in March to 10.0% in June. The drop was also large\nfor GPT-3.5 (from 22.0% to 2.0%). GPT-4’s verbosity,, measured by number of characters in the\ngenerations,, also increased by 20%. (b) An example query and the corresponding responses. In March,,\nboth GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 followed the user instruction ( “the code only” ) and thus produced directly\nexecutable generation. In June,, however,, they added extra triple quotes before and after the code\nsnippet,, rendering the code not executable.\n3.6 LangChain HotpotQA Agent: Poor Prompt Stability\nMany real-world applications require LLMs to answer knowledge-intensive questions grounded in various\ndata sources,, including “multi-hop” questions that involve multiple sources and/or reasoning steps.\nTherefore,, it is natural to monitor how LLMs’ ability to answer multi-hop questions evolves over time.\nWe take a first step by measuring the drifts of a LangChain HotpotQA Agent [ Tea23 ],, a pipeline to\nanswer complex multi-hop questions similar to those from HotpotQA [ YQZ+18]. This agent leveraged\nLLMs to search over Wikipedia passages to answer complex questions. We pick this pipeline for two\nreasons. First,, LangChain is one of the most popular software frameworks for working with LLMs,,\nproviding open source modules that have been “prompt-engineered” to perform various tasks well. The\nstability of these modules’ prompts over time is therefore of interest to many users. Second,, HotpotQA\nis widely used to measure an LLM’s ability to answer multi-hop questions. Specifically,, we used the\ndefault ReAct Agent in LangChain3(designed to reproduce ReAct prompting [ YZY+22]) with different\nLLMs (GPT-4 and GPT-3.5) as the backbone for our code. Then we asked the agent to answer each\nquery in the HotpotQA dataset.\nOverall,, we observed significant drifts for both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 on this task. For example,, the\n3https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/react_docstore\n12\n\nTable 4: Effects of removing non-code text around generated code.

(a) Drifts on exact match,, verbosity,, and mismatch rate.\nOverall,, GPT-4 matched more ground-truth while GPT-3.5 became worse. (b) An example query and\ncorresponding answers. LangChain was not able to parse March GPT-4’s response because it failed to\nfollow the format specified in the LangChain prompt. GPT-3.5 in June could not find the information\nthat it was able to obtain in March. These issues highlight the stability issues of integrating LLM into\nlarger pipelines.\nexact match rate for GPT-4 was only 1.2% in March,, but became 37.8% in June,, as shown in Figure\n10(a). Opposite trends were observed for GPT-3.5: the exact match rate dropped by almost 9% from\nMarch to June. Moreover,, more than 80% of final answers between March and June did not match for\nboth models. We also noticed that GPT-4’s generation in June became more concise than in March,,\nwhile GPT-3.5’s generation was 30% more verbose over time.\nWhy did this happen? A closer look at the mismatched answers suggests the poor prompt stability\nas one of the explanations. To see this,, consider the example in Figure 10(b). The query was about\nwhether two people were Democrats or Republicans. GPT-4 in March was actually able to find the\ncorrect answer: they both were Democrats. However,, the LangChain agent expected a specific format:\nthe generation from LLM must be “[action]+text”,, which was encoded in its prompts. Unfortunately,,\nGPT-4 in March failed to follow this format,, and thus the LangChain agent simply generated an\nerror message “could not parse LLM Output”. This is problematic in real-world LLM applications,, as\nmanually debugging such issues is challenging in large pipelines. In addition,, GPT-3.5 in March found\nthe right answer. In June,, however,, it “was not able to find information”. These issues indicate how\nbrittle existing prompting methods and libraries can be for complex tasks in the face of LLM drift.\n3.7 USMLE Medical Exam: Small Decrease in GPT-4 Performance\nWe study next how performance of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 change over time on a professional domain:\ntaking USMLE [ KCM+23],, a medical exam required for doctors in the US. USMLE has been used to\nbenchmark LLMs’ medical knowledge.\nOverall,, we observe a slight performance decrease.

This patient is presenting with symptoms of bulimia\nnervosa,, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances due to frequent\nvomiting. The decreased K+ and Cl⁻ levels are due to loss through\nvomiting,, while the increased HCO³⁻ level is a compensatory\nmechanism to counteract the metabolic acidosis caused by the loss\nof stomach acid through vomiting. Tender parotid glands and poor\ndentition are also common physical ﬁndings in patients with bulimia\nnervosa.\nStep 1: Analyze the patient\'s symptoms and history.-The patient is a 20-year-old woman who is a sophomore in\ncollege.- She overeats in response to the stress of her classes and induces vomiting after consuming a signiﬁcant\namount of food.- She vomits almost daily and feels ""too full"" and ""out of control.""- She feels she is slightly\noverweight.- She is physically active and exercises moderately two to three times weekly.\xa0- She does not use\nlaxatives or diuretics.- She has many friends and enjoys going out socially.\xa0- She drinks three to four beers on\nweekends and does not use illicit drugs.\xa0- She appears uncomfortable and is tearful and mildly diaphoretic.- She\nhas tender parotid glands bilaterally and poor dentition.\nStep 2: Identify the relevant ﬁndings.\xa0\xa0- The patient\'s BMI is 24 kg/m²,, which indicates she is slightly overweight.\xa0-\nHer temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F),, pulse is 115/min and regular,, and blood pressure is 100/68 mm Hg.\xa0- She has\ntender parotid glands bilaterally and poor dentition.\nStep 3: Formulate a hypothesis.\xa0Based on the patient\'s symptoms and ﬁndings,, it is likely that she is suﬀering from\nbulimia nervosa,, a type of eating disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by\ncompensatory behaviors such as self-induced vomiting.\nStep 4: Determine the expected laboratory ﬁndings.\xa0In patients with bulimia nervosa,, the most common electrolyte\nabnormalities are hypokalemia (decreased K+),, hypochloremia (decreased Cl⁻),, and metabolic alkalosis (increased\nHCO³⁻) due to repeated vomiting and loss of gastric acid.\nStep 5: Compare the expected laboratory ﬁndings with the answer choices.The answer choice that matches the\nexpected laboratory ﬁndings is (A) K+ is Decreased,, Cl⁻ is decreased,, HCO³⁻ is decreased.\xa0Therefore,, the answer is\n(A) K+ is Decreased,, Cl⁻ is decreased,, HCO³⁻ is decreased.Accuracy Verbosity Mismatch Accuracy Verbosity Mismatcha\nb\nExampleYou are an expert in medical exams.

Overall,, 12.2% of GPT-4’s answers in June were different from their\ncounterparts in March. (b) An example query and model answers. GPT-4 didn’t follow CoT instructions\nin this example. The longer reasoning steps by GPT-3.5 in June actually led to the wrong answer.\ndropped from 86.6% to 82.4%. There was also a 0.8% accuracy loss for GPT-3.5. Interestingly,, GPT-3.5\nbecame much more verbose from March to June. It is also worth noting a relatively large answer\nmismatch between March and June for both models. In fact,, 12.2% answers in March were different\nfrom their counterparts in June for GPT-4,, and the mismatch rate was 27.9% for GPT-3.5. These two\nare much larger than the accuracy changes. This effectively means that the June versions corrected\nprevious errors but also made additional mistakes. Overall,, we also found that GPT-4 June was much\nless verbose in its response compared to GPT-4 March,, while GPT-3.5’s responses to USMLE questions\nbecame longer.\n3.8 Visual Reasoning: Small Improvements in Both Models\nFinally,, we investigate LLM drifts for visual reasoning. This task differs from other scenarios because it\nrequires abstract reasoning. The ARC dataset [ Cho19 ] is commonly used to assess visual reasoning\nability. The task is to create a output grid corresponding to an input grid,, based solely on a few similar\nexamples. Figure 12(b) gives one example query from ARC. To show the visual objects to LLM services,,\nwe represent the input and output grids by 2-D arrays,, where the value of each element denotes the\ncolor. We fed the LLM services 467 samples in the ARC dataset that fits in all services’ context window.\n14\n\n77.1%\n00.20.40.60.81\n235.4 243.1\nMarch 2023 June 2023050100150200250300350400\n10.9% 14.3%\nMarch 2023 June 202300.20.40.60.81\n64.5%\n00.20.40.60.81GPT-4 GPT-3.5\nMarch 2023\nJune 2023Exact Match Verbosity Mismatch Verbosity Mismatcha\nb\nExample\nNow you behave as a human expert for puzzle\nsolving.

(a) Overall performance. For both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5,, there was a\n2% improvement of the exact match rate from March to June. The generation length remained roughly\nthe same. More than 60% generation changed from March to June. (b) An example query and the\ncorresponding responses. While overall GPT-4 became better over time,, it was worse on this particular\nquery. It gave the correct grid in March but the wrong one in June.\nThen we measured the exact match between their generation and the ground truth.\nAs shown in Figure 12(a),, there were marginal performance improvements for both GPT-4 and\nGPT-3.5. However,, for more than 90% visual puzzle queries,, the March and June versions produced\nthe exact same generation. These services’ overall performance were also low: 27.4% for GPT-4 and\n12.2% for GPT-3.5.\nIt is worthy noting that LLM services did not uniformly make better generations over time. In\nfact,, despite better overall performance,, GPT-4 in June made mistakes on queries on which it was\ncorrect for in March. Figure 12(b) gives one such example. This underlines the need of fine-grained\ndrift monitoring,, especially for critical applications.\n4 Is GPT-4’s instruction following getting worse over time?\nHow to interpret the observed behavior drift? In our experiments,, decrease in LLM’s performance is\noften associated with worse instruction following (i.e. worse ability in following users’ instructions). On\nthe Math I and Math II tasks,, for example,, GPT-4 followed the user instructions to perform step-by-step\nreasoning and then answer the questions in March,, but refused to do so in June. OpinionQA offers\nanother example: GPT-4 responded to users’ questions in March but did not respond in June.\nQuantifying instruction following drift on single instructions. Quantifying instruction following\ndrift on existing LLM benchmarks is challenging: their tasks and evaluation metrics often blur a model’\ninstruction fidelity and its task-specific abilities (such as writing and logic reasoning) and knowledge\n(commonsense,, history,, etc). Hence,, we have curated a new benchmark focused on task-agnostic\ninstructions. This includes four types of instructions that often arise in practice: answer extractions (\n“answer yes or no within squared brackets”),, stop apologizing (“do not say sorry or as an AI model”),,\nwriting constraint (“describe X by words starting/ending with Y ”),, and text formatting (“add squared\nbrackets to each single word’s first letter (including article word like ‘the’).”). We apply answer\nextraction and text formatting on the abstracts of 200 recent arxiv papers,, and content filtering on the\nsenstiveQA dataset. We manually created 20 style refinement queries.\nAs shown in Figure 13,, there was indeed a large instruction fidelity drop of GPT-4 from March\nto June. For example,, GPT-4 followed 99.5% answer extraction queries in March,, while the number\n15\n\nDoes the following paragraph\ncontain numbers? Answer yes or\nno in squared brackets.

(a) Overall instruction\nfollowing. (b) example responses by GPT-4. In a nutshell,, GPT-4 followed most individual instructions\nin March,, but ignored them in June. Consider answer extraction as an example: 99.5% queries were\nfollowed by GPT-4 in March,, but the number became almost 0 in June. Similarly,, the fidelity rate\ndropped from 74.0% in March to 19.0% in June on the content filtering queries. The example response\nrevealed some infidelity patterns of GPT-4 in June. It insisted on capitalizing the letter (answer\nextraction),, kept generating “sorry” when users asked not to do it (stop apologizing),, ignoring the word\nending letters (writing constraint),, and missed a few letter to add brackets (text formatting).\ndropped to 0.5% in June. On 74% sensitive questions,, GPT-4 mentioned no “sorry” or “as an AI model”\nas the instructions request in March. However,, this number became only 19% in June. The examples\ngiven in Figure 13 offer more insights on what led to June version’s low fidelity. For example,, GPT-4\nin June did place the answer in the squared brackets,, but it consistently capitalize the first letter.\nSimilarly,, while users asked not to say sorry,, GPT-4 kept generating sorry in June,, while its March\nversion rephrased its answer to follow the user request. On the writing constraint example,, GPT-4 in\nMarch followed the user instruction exactly: it generated words related to machine learning and ending\nin “n”. The June version,, however,, focused on “machine learning” but ignored the “ending with ‘n’\n” requirement. GPT-4 successfully capitalized first letter for each word in March,, but missed a few\nwords (such as “provides” and “about” in the shown example) in June. Overall,, GPT-4’s instruction\nfollowing fidelity decreased from March to June,, which partially explained its behavior drifts.\nInstruction following drift on composite instructions. We further study how GPT-4’s instruction\nfollowing changes on compositions of instructions. To quantify this,, we collected a set of single\ninstructions,, and then created a list of composite instructions,, each of which corresponds to two\ninstructions from the single instruction set.

Overall,, GPT-4 became more\nprune to composite instructions from March to June. For example,, GPT-4’s accuracy on individual\ninstructions “add comma” and “capitalize” remained roughly the same between March and June.\nHowever,, to process their composition,, the accuracy dropped by 9.2% from March to June.\ninstructions applied on arxiv papers’ first sentences. The single instruction set contains three text\nformatting instructions: add comma (“add a comma to each word”),, no quotation (“remove quotations”),,\nand capitalize (“capitalize each letter”). These instructions are easy to understand by humans and also\ncommonly seen in real-world applications.\nThere are several interesting observations. First,, GPT-4 followed the single instructions well in\nboth March and June. In fact,, the instruction following shifts on individual instructions are only -2%,,\n+4.0%,, and -1.0% from March to June (Figure 14 (a)). Second,, GPT-4 in June was much prune to\ncomposite instructions than that in March. For example,, when asked to remove quotations as well as\nadd a comma to each word,, GPT-4’s performance dropped by 24% from March to June. Similarly,,\nswitching from March to June caused a 9.2% accuracy drop on the composition of adding a comma\nand capitalizing letters. It is interesting to recognize the mistake patterns triggered by the composition.\nAs shown in the example from Figure 14,, GPT-4 in June tended to add a comma to each character\nwhen given the composite instruction. On the other hand,, its March counterpart faithfully completed\nthe user task.\nOverall,, we observe that GPT-4 followed less user instructions over time. This holds for both\nsingle instructions and composite instructions. Consistent with the performance shifts analyzed in the\n17\n\nprevious section,, instruction following shifts appear a primary factor of GPT-4’s behavior drifts. In\ncomparison,, there was not a consistent change in GPT-3.5’s instruction following over time (see Figure\n16 in the Appendix).\n5 Conclusions and Future Work\nOur findings demonstrate that the behavior of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 has varied significantly over a\nrelatively short amount of time. This highlights the need to continuously evaluate and assess the\nbehavior of LLM drifts in applications,, especially as it is not transparent how LLMs such as ChatGPT\nare updated over time. Our study also underscores the challenge of uniformly improving LLMs’\nmultifaceted abilities. Improving the model’s performance on some tasks,, for example with fine-tuning\non additional data,, can have unexpected side effects on its behavior in other tasks. Consistent with\nthis,, both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 got worse on some tasks but saw improvements in other dimensions.\nMoreover,, the trends for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are often divergent. Beyond the final performances,, it’s\ninteresting to observe shifts in chain-of-thought behaviors and verbosity of the models.\nWe plan to update the findings presented here in an ongoing long-term study by regularly evaluating\nGPT-3.5,, GPT-4 and other LLMs on diverse tasks over time. For users or companies who rely on\nLLM services as a component in their ongoing workflow,, we recommend that they should implement\nsimilar monitoring analysis as we do here for their applications. We thank the many people who have\nprovided helpful feedback to our work. To encourage further research on LLM drifts,, we have release\nour evaluation data and ChatGPT responses at https://github.com/lchen001/LLMDrift .\n18\n\nReferences\n[AAKA23] Rachith Aiyappa,, Jisun An,, Haewoon Kwak,, and Yong-Yeol Ahn.

Un-\nfortunately,, existing LM pipelines are typically implemented using hard-coded\n“prompt templates”,, i.e. lengthy strings discovered via trial and error. Toward a\nmore systematic approach for developing and optimizing LM pipelines,, we intro-\nduce DSPy,, a programming model that abstracts LM pipelines as text transforma-\ntion graphs ,, i.e. imperative computation graphs where LMs are invoked through\ndeclarative modules. DSPy modules are parameterized ,, meaning they can learn\n(by creating and collecting demonstrations) how to apply compositions of prompt-\ning,, finetuning,, augmentation,, and reasoning techniques. We design a compiler\nthat will optimize any DSPy pipeline to maximize a given metric. We conduct\ntwo case studies,, showing that succinct DSPy programs can express and optimize\nsophisticated LM pipelines that reason about math word problems,, tackle multi-\nhop retrieval,, answer complex questions,, and control agent loops. Within minutes\nof compiling,, a few lines of DSPy allow GPT-3.5 andllama2-13b-chat to self-\nbootstrap pipelines that outperform standard few-shot prompting (generally by\nover 25% and 65%,, respectively) and pipelines with expert-created demonstra-\ntions (by up to 5–46% and 16–40%,, respectively). On top of that,, DSPy pro-\ngrams compiled to open and relatively small LMs like 770M-parameter T5and\nllama2-13b-chat are competitive with approaches that rely on expert-written\nprompt chains for proprietary GPT-3.5 .\nDSPy is available at https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy .\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nLanguage models (LMs) are enabling researchers to build NLP systems at higher levels of abstrac-\ntion and with lower data requirements than ever before (Bommasani et al.,, 2021). This is fueling an\nexploding space of “prompting” techniques—and lightweight finetuning techniques—for adapting\nLMs to new tasks (Kojima et al.,, 2022),, eliciting systematic reasoning from them (Wei et al.,, 2022;\nWang et al.,, 2022b),, and augmenting them with retrieved sources (Guu et al.,, 2020; Lazaridou et al.,,\n2022; Khattab et al.,, 2022) or with tools (Yao et al.,, 2022; Schick et al.,, 2023). Most of these tech-\nniques are explored in isolation,, but interest has been growing in building multi-stage pipelines and\nagents that decompose complex tasks into more manageable calls to LMs in an effort to improve\nperformance (Qi et al.,, 2019; Khattab et al.,, 2021a; Karpas et al.,, 2022; Dohan et al.,, 2022; Khot\net al.,, 2022; Khattab et al.,, 2022; Chen et al.,, 2022; Pourreza & Rafiei,, 2023; Shinn et al.,, 2023).\nUnfortunately,, LMs are known to be sensitive to how they are prompted for each task,, and this is\nexacerbated in pipelines where multiple LM calls have to interact effectively. As a result,, the LM\n1arXiv:2310.03714v1  [cs.CL]  5 Oct 2023\n\nPreprint\ncalls in existing LM pipelines and in popular developer frameworks are generally implemented using\nhard-coded ‘prompt templates’,, that is,, long strings of instructions and demonstrations that are hand\ncrafted through manual trial and error. We argue that this approach,, while pervasive,, can be brittle\nand unscalable—conceptually akin to hand-tuning the weights for a classifier. A given string prompt\nmight not generalize to different pipelines or across different LMs,, data domains,, or even inputs.\nToward a more systematic approach to designing AI pipelines,, we introduce the DSPy programming\nmodel.1DSPy pushes building new LM pipelines away from manipulating free-form strings and\ncloser to programming (composing modular operators to build text transformation graphs) where a\ncompiler automatically generates optimized LM invocation strategies and prompts from a program.\nWe draw inspiration from the consensus that emerged around neural network abstractions (Bergstra\net al.,, 2013),, where (1) many general-purpose layers can be modularly composed in any complex\narchitecture and (2) the model weights can be trained using optimizers instead of being hand-tuned.\nTo this end,, we propose the DSPy programming model (Sec 3). We first translate string-based\nprompting techniques,, including complex and task-dependent ones like Chain of Thought (Wei et al.,,\n2022) and ReAct (Yao et al.,, 2022),, into declarative modules that carry natural-language typed sig-\nnatures . DSPy modules are task-adaptive components—akin to neural network layers—that abstract\nany particular text transformation,, like answering a question or summarizing a paper. We then pa-\nrameterize each module so that it can learn its desired behavior by iteratively bootstrapping useful\ndemonstrations within the pipeline. Inspired directly by PyTorch abstractions (Paszke et al.,, 2019),,\nDSPy modules are used via expressive define-by-run computational graphs. Pipelines are expressed\nby (1) declaring the modules needed and (2) using these modules in any logical control flow (e.g.,,\nifstatements,, forloops,, exceptions,, etc.) to logically connect the modules.\nWe then develop the DSPy compiler (Sec 4),, which optimizes any DSPy program to improve quality\nor cost. The compiler inputs are the program,, a few training inputs with optional labels,, and a valida-\ntion metric. The compiler simulates versions of the program on the inputs and bootstraps example\ntraces of each module for self-improvement,, using them to construct effective few-shot prompts\nor finetuning small LMs for steps of the pipeline. Optimization in DSPy is highly modular: it is\nconducted by teleprompters ,,2which are general-purpose optimization strategies that determine how\nthe modules should learn from data. In this way,, the compiler automatically maps the declarative\nmodules to high-quality compositions of prompting,, finetuning,, reasoning,, and augmentation.\nProgramming models like DSPy could be assessed along many dimensions,, but we focus on the role\nof expert-crafted prompts in shaping system performance. We are seeking to reduce or even remove\ntheir role through DSPy modules (e.g.,, versions of popular techniques like Chain of Thought) and\nteleprompters. We report on two expansive case studies: math word problems (GMS8K; Cobbe et al.\n2021) and multi-hop question answering (HotPotQA; Yang et al. 2018) with explorations of chain\nof thought,, multi-chain reflection,, multi-hop retrieval,, retrieval-augmented question answering,, and\nagent loops. Our evaluations use a number of different compiling strategies effectively and show\nthat straightforward DSPy programs outperform systems using hand-crafted prompts,, while also\nallowing our programs to use much smaller and hence more efficient LMs effectively.\nOverall,, this work proposes the first programming model that translates prompting techniques into\nparameterized declarative modules and introduces an effective compiler with general optimiza-\ntion strategies (teleprompters) to optimize arbitrary pipelines of these modules. Our main contri-\nbutions are empirical and algorithmic: with DSPy,, we have found that we can implement very\nshort programs that can bootstrap self-improving multi-stage NLP systems using LMs as small as\nllama2-13b-chat andT5-Large (770M parameters). Without hand-crafted prompts and within\nminutes to tens of minutes of compiling,, compositions of DSPy modules can raise the quality of\nsimple programs from 33% to 82% (Sec 6) and from 32% to 46% (Sec 7) for GPT-3.5 and,, simi-\nlarly,, from 9% to 47% (Sec 6) and from 22% to 41% (Sec 7) for llama2-13b-chat .\n1DSPy is pronounced dee-ess-pie . It’s the second iteration of our earlier Demonstrate–Search–Predict\nframework (DSP; Khattab et al. 2022). This paper introduces the key concepts in DSPy. For more extensive and\nup-to-date documentation of the framework,, we refer readers to https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy .\n2We derive the name tele-prompters from the notion of abstracting and automating the task of prompting,,\nin particular,, such that it happens at a distance ,, without manual intervention.\n2\n\nPreprint\n2 R ELATED WORK\nThis work is inspired by the role that Torch (Collobert et al.,, 2002),, Theano (Bergstra et al.,, 2010;\n2011; Al-Rfou et al.,, 2016),, Chainer (Tokui et al.,, 2015),, and others played in the development in\ndeep learning by providing powerful abstractions. A similar transformation is emerging with higher-\nlevel pipelines of LMs,, and we are seeking to offer a solid conceptual framework and programming\nabstractions for what we call foundation model programming . We draw on differentiable program-\nming (Wang et al.,, 2018) but applied to LM calls rather than neural networks,, and borrow syntactic\nelements from PyTorch (Paszke et al.,, 2019).\nIn-context learning (McCann et al. 2018; Radford et al. 2018; Brown et al. 2020) is a key mechanism\nfor foundation model programming. A growing body of work has revealed that,, especially with\ninstruction tuning (Ouyang et al.,, 2022),, we can elicit sophisticated behavior via prompting (Wei\net al.,, 2022; Wang et al.,, 2022b; Press et al.,, 2022; Yao et al.,, 2022; Khot et al.,, 2022; Madaan et al.,,\n2023). Similarly,, forms of weak supervision that would normally require task-specific (Khattab\net al.,, 2021a;b) or hand-built (Ratner et al.,, 2016; Hancock et al.,, 2018) heuristics are now done by\nLMs (Wang et al.,, 2022b; Zelikman et al.,, 2022; Zhang et al.,, 2022; Shao et al.,, 2023).\nIn-context learning methods now routinely invoke tools,, leading to LM pipelines that use retrieval\nmodels (Chen et al.,, 2017; Lewis et al.,, 2020; Guu et al.,, 2020; Lazaridou et al.,, 2022; Izacard et al.,,\n2022),, multimodal foundation models,, and more traditional tools like APIs (Nakano et al.,, 2021)\nand calculators. A number of toolkits have been developed to facilitate this,, including LangChain\n(Chase,, 2022),, Semantic Kernel (Microsoft,, 2023),, LlamaIndex (Liu,, 2022),, and many other re-\ntrieval and agent libraries. These toolkits provide pre-packaged chains and agents that connect\nLMs with numerous accessible tools. However,, they suffer from the pervasive prompt engineering\nchallenges we address in DSPy: they express task-specific behavior through hand-written prompt\ntemplates (for detailed discussion,, see Appendix B).\nResearchers are starting to apply discrete optimization and RL to find effective prompts,, generally\nfor a single logical LM call (Guo et al.,, 2023; Pryzant et al.,, 2023; Huang et al.,, 2022; Yang et al.,,\n2023). DSPy seeks to generalize this space: it offers a rich framework for optimizing arbitrary\npipelines from high-level declarative signatures ,, by bootstrapping high-quality multi-stage demon-\nstrations with constraints. In this framework,, DSPy teleprompters may apply optimization using\nmodel selection techniques like cross-validation or,, in principle,, with sophisticated techniques in-\nvolving RL and LM feedback (Hu et al.,, 2023; Zhao et al.,, 2023a; Shinn et al.,, 2023) or learned or\nBayesian hyperparameter optimization methods (Bergstra et al.,, 2013; Akiba et al.,, 2019).\nThe present paper seeks to motivate DSPy as a programming model and to report new empirical\nfindings from applying the DSPy compiler. This is inspired by formative work by Bergstra et al.\n(2010; 2013),, Paszke et al. (2019),, and Wolf et al. (2020),, who support their respective programming\nmodels with a mix of benchmark numbers and some qualitative measures. For the current paper,, we\nfocus on showing that DSPy and its compiler allow us to build outstanding LM systems without\nhand-crafted prompt strings,, but instead from truly modular units,, and that this opens up doors for\nsystematically exploring a rich design space at a very high programmatic level of abstraction.\n3 T HEDSP YPROGRAMMING MODEL\nWe present DSPy,, which treats LMs as abstract devices for text generation,,3and optimizes their us-\nage in arbitrary computational graphs. DSPy programs are expressed in Python: each program takes\nthe task input (e.g.,, a question to answer or a paper to summarize) and returns the output (e.g.,, an\nanswer or a summary) after a series of steps. DSPy contributes three abstractions toward automatic\noptimization: signatures,, modules,, and teleprompters. Signatures abstract the input/output behavior\nof a module; modules replace existing hand-prompting techniques and can be composed in arbitrary\npipelines; and teleprompters optimize all modules in the pipeline to maximize a metric.\n3We assume access to one or more LMs,, which consume a prompt string and return text completions. This\nmay be a promptable LM capable of in-context learning (e.g.,, GPT-3.5 or Llama2-7b) or a smaller finetuneable\nLM (e.g.,, T5-base). An LM may be selected as the default; operations will use it unless configured otherwise.\n3\n\nPreprint\n3.1 N ATURAL LANGUAGE SIGNATURES CAN ABSTRACT PROMPTING &FINETUNING\nInstead of free-form string prompts,, DSPy programs use natural language signatures to assign work\nto the LM. A DSPy signature is natural-language typed declaration of a function: a short declarative\nspec that tells DSPy what a text transformation needs to do (e.g.,, “consume questions and return\nanswers”),, rather than how a specific LM should be prompted to implement that behavior. More\nformally,, a DSPy signature is a tuple of input fields andoutput fields (and an optional instruction ).\nA field consists of field name and optional metadata.4In typical usage,, the roles of fields are inferred\nby DSPy as a function of field names. For instance,, the DSPy compiler will use in-context learning\nto interpret question differently from answer and will iteratively refine its usage of these fields.\nSignatures offer two benefits over prompts: they can be compiled into self-improving and pipeline-\nadaptive prompts or finetunes. This is primarily done by bootstrapping (Sec 4) useful demonstrating\nexamples for each signature. Additionally,, they handle structured formatting and parsing logic to\nreduce (or,, ideally,, avoid) brittle string manipulation in user programs.\nIn practice,, DSPy signatures can be expressed with a shorthand notation like question -> answer ,,\nso that line 1 in the following is a complete DSPy program for a basic question-answering system\n(with line 2 illustrating usage and line 3 the response when GPT-3.5 is the LM):\n1qa = dspy.Predict(""question -> answer"")\n2qa(question=""Where is Guaran ´ı spoken?"")\n3# Out: Prediction(answer=’Guaran ´ı is spoken mainly in South America.’)\nIn the shorthand notation,, each field’s name indicates the semantic role that the input (or output)\nfield plays in the transformation. DSPy will parse this notation and expand the field names into\nmeaningful instructions for the LM,, so that english document -> french translation would\nprompt for English to French translation. When needed,, DSPy offers more advanced programming\ninterfaces for expressing more explicit constraints on signatures (Appendix A).\n3.2 P ARAMETERIZED &TEMPLATED MODULES CAN ABSTRACT PROMPTING TECHNIQUES\nAkin to type signatures in programming languages,, DSPy signatures simply define an interface and\nprovide type-like hints on the expected behavior. To use a signature,, we must declare a module with\nthat signature,, like we instantiated a Predict module above. A module declaration like this returns\nafunction having that signature.\nThePredict Module The core module for working with signatures in DSPy is Predict (simplified\npseudocode in Appendix D.1). Internally,, Predict stores the supplied signature,, an optional LM to\nuse (initially None ,, but otherwise overrides the default LM for this module),, and a list of demon-\nstrations for prompting (initially empty). Like layers in PyTorch,, the instantiated module behaves as\na callable function: it takes in keyword arguments corresponding to the signature input fields (e.g.,,\nquestion ),, formats a prompt to implement the signature and includes the appropriate demonstra-\ntions,, calls the LM,, and parses the output fields. When Predict detects it’s being used in compile\nmode,, it will also internally track input/output traces to assist the teleprompter at bootstrapping the\ndemonstrations.\nOther Built-in Modules DSPy modules translate prompting techniques into modular functions that\nsupport any signature,, contrasting with the standard approach of prompting LMs with task-specific\ndetails (e.g.,, hand-written few-shot examples). To this end,, DSPy includes a number of more sophis-\nticated modules like ChainOfThought ,,ProgramOfThought ,,MultiChainComparison ,, andReAct .5\nThese can all be used interchangeably to implement a DSPy signature. For instance,, simply chang-\n4String descriptions of the task and the fields are also optional and usually omitted. Fields can carry optional\nfield prefix anddescription . By default,, fields are assumed to hold free-form strings; we are actively exploring\noptional data type as a way to specify constraints on valid values (e.g.,, bool orint) and more gracefully handle\nformatting and parsing logic,, though this feature is not core to DSPy at the time of writing.\n5These modules generalize prompting techniques from the literature,, respectively,, by Wei et al. (2022),,\nChen et al. (2022),, Yoran et al. (2023),, and Yao et al. (2022) and,, in doing so,, generalize the ideas on zero-shot\nprompting and rationale self-generation from Kojima et al. (2022),, Zelikman et al. (2022),, Zhang et al. (2022),,\nand Huang et al. (2022) to parameterized modules that can bootstrap arbitrary multi-stage pipelines.\n4\n\nPreprint\ningPredict toChainOfThought in the above program leads to a system that thinks step by step\nbefore committing to its output field.\nImportantly,, all of these modules are implemented in a few lines of code by expanding the user-\ndefined signature and calling Predict one or more times on new signatures as appropriate. For\ninstance,, we show a simplified implementation of the built-in ChainOfThought below.\n1class ChainOfThought(dspy.Module):\n2def __init__(self,, signature):\n3 # Modify signature from ‘*inputs -> *outputs‘ to ‘*inputs -> rationale,, *outputs‘.\n4 rationale_field = dspy.OutputField(prefix=""Reasoning: Let’s think step by step."")\n5 signature = dspy.Signature(signature).prepend_output_field(rationale_field)\n6\n7 # Declare a sub-module with the modified signature.\n8 self.predict = dspy.Predict(signature)\n9\n10def forward(self,, **kwargs):\n11 # Just forward the inputs to the sub-module.\n12 return self.predict(**kwargs)\nThis is a fully-fledged module capable of learning effective few-shot prompting for any LM or task.\nWe contrast that with Appendix C,, which copies long reasoning prompts hand-written by sources\nranging from recent research to popular prompting libraries.\nParameterization Uniquely,, DSPy parameterizes these prompting techniques. To understand this\nparameterization,, observe that any LM call seeking to implement a particular signature needs to\nspecify parameters that include: (1) the specific LM to call (Chen et al.,, 2023),, (2) the prompt in-\nstructions (Yang et al.,, 2023) and the string prefix of each signature field and,, most importantly,, (3)\nthe demonstrations used as few-shot prompts (for frozen LMs) or as training data (for finetuning).\nWe focus primarily on automatically generating and selecting useful demonstrations. In our case\nstudies,, we find that bootstrapping good demonstrations gives us a powerful way to teach sophisti-\ncated pipelines of LMs new behaviors systematically.\nTools DSPy programs may use tools,, which are modules that execute computation. We support re-\ntrieval models through a dspy.Retrieve module. At the time of writing,, DSPy has built-in support\nfor ColBERTv2,, Pyserini,, and Pinecone retrievers,, and we have explored experimental dspy.SQL\nfor executing SQL queries and dspy.PythonInterpreter for executing Python code in a sandbox.\nPrograms DSPy modules can be composed in arbitrary pipelines in a define-by-run interface. In-\nspired directly by PyTorch and Chainer,, one first declares the modules needed at initialization,, allow-\ning DSPy to keep track of them for optimization,, and then one expresses the pipeline with arbitrary\ncode that calls the modules in a forward method. As a simple illustration,, we offer the following\nsimple but complete retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system.\n1class RAG(dspy.Module):\n2def __init__(self,, num_passages=3):\n3 # ‘Retrieve‘ will use the user’s default retrieval settings unless overriden.\n4 self.retrieve = dspy.Retrieve(k=num_passages)\n5 # ‘ChainOfThought‘ with signature that generates answers given retrieval & question.\n6 self.generate_answer = dspy.ChainOfThought(""context,, question -> answer"")\n7\n8def forward(self,, question):\n9 context = self.retrieve(question).passages\n10 return self.generate_answer(context=context,, question=question)\nTo highlight modularity,, we use ChainOfThought as a drop-in replacement of the basic Predict .\nOne can now simply write RAG()(""Where is Guaran ´ı spoken?"") to use it. Notice that,, if we\nuse a signature ""context,, question -> search query"" ,, we get a system that generates search\nqueries rather than answers.\n3.3 T ELEPROMPTERS CAN AUTOMATE PROMPTING FOR ARBITRARY PIPELINES\nWhen compiling a DSPy program,, we generally invoke a teleprompter ,, which is an optimizer that\ntakes the program,, a training set,, and a metric—and returns a new optimized program. Different\nteleprompters (Sec 4) apply different strategies for optimization.\n5\n\nPreprint\nIn DSPy,, training sets may be small ,, potentially a handful of examples,, though larger data enables\nmore powerful optimization. Training examples may be incomplete ,, i.e.,, only input values are nec-\nessary. Labels for the pipeline steps are not required,, unless they need to be used in the metric. In\npractice,, we typically assume labels only for (at most) the program’s final output,, not the intermedi-\nate steps. This label-efficiency is critical for modularity: building a new pipeline in DSPy requires\nsimply recompiling the new pipeline’s code,, not annotating data specific to the new pipeline.\nMetrics can be simple notions like exact match (EM) or F1,, but they can be entire DSPy programs\nthat balance multiple concerns. For example,, we may compile the RAG module above against a\ndataset of question–answer pairs qatrainset and the metric EM. The goal of optimization here is\nto effectively bootstrap few-shot demonstrations. The following code achieves this:\n1# Small training set with only questions and final answers.\n2qa_trainset = [dspy.Example(question=""What is the capital of France?"",, answer=""Paris"")]\n3\n4# The teleprompter will bootstrap missing labels: reasoning chains and retrieval contexts.\n5teleprompter = dspy.BootstrapFewShot(metric=dspy.evaluate.answer_exact_match)\n6compiled_rag = teleprompter.compile(RAG(),, trainset=qa_trainset)\nIn this example,, the BootstrapFewShot teleprompter (Sec 4,, Appendix E.1) simulates RAGon the\ntraining example(s). It will collect demonstrations of each module (i.e.,, examples of its input–output\nbehavior) that collectively lead to valid output (i.e.,, respecting the signatures and the metric).\nIf one wanted to push the compiled program to be extractive given its retrieved contexts,, one could\ndefine a custom metric to use in place of dspy.evaluate.answer exactmatch :\n1def answer_and_context_match(example,, pred,, trace=None):\n2answer_match = dspy.evaluate.answer_exact_match(example,, pred)\n3\n4# Is the prediction a substring of some passage?\n5context_match = any((pred.answer.lower() in c) for c in pred.context)\n6\n7return answer_match and context_match\nNotice that behavior like this might be more accurately checked by another DSPy program that\nchecks for faithful grounding of answers. Such metrics are fully supported and encouraged in DSPy.\nTeleprompters can be composed by specifying a teacher program. DSPy will sample demonstra-\ntions from this program for prompt optimization. This composition can enable very rich pipelines,,\nwhere expensive programs (e.g.,, complex expensive ensembles using large LMs) supervise cheap\nprograms (e.g.,, simple pipelines using smaller LMs). One may start with compiled ragfrom above\n(say,, compiled to use a large Llama2-13b-chat LM) but now fine-tune Flan-T5-large to create an\nefficient program:\n1# Larger set of questions with *no labels*. Labels for all steps will be bootstrapped.\n2unlabeled_questions = [dspy.Example(question=""What is the capital of Germany?""),, ...]\n3\n4# As we assumes no answer,, we use ‘answer_passage_match‘ to filter ungrounded answers.\n5finetuning_teleprompter = BootstrapFinetune(metric=dspy.evaluate.answer_passage_match)\n6\n7# We set ‘teacher=compiled_rag‘ to compose. Bootstrapping will now use ‘compiled_rag‘.\n8compiled_rag_via_finetune = finetuning_teleprompter.compile(RAG(),, teacher=compiled_rag,,\ntrainset=unlabeled_questions,, target=’google/flan-t5-large’)\n4 T HEDSP YCOMPILER\nA key source of DSPy’s expressive power is its ability to compile—or automatically optimize—any\nprogram in this programming model. Compiling relies on a teleprompter,, which is an optimizer for\nDSPy programs that improves the quality (or cost) of modules via prompting or finetuning,, which\nare unified in DSPy. While DSPy does not enforce this when creating new teleprompters,, typical\nteleprompters go through three stages.\nStage 1: Candidate Generation The compiler first (recursively) finds all unique Predict modules\n(predictors) in a program,, including those nested under other modules. For each unique predictor\np,, the teleprompter may generate candidate values for the parameters of p: the instructions,, field\ndescriptions,, or—most importantly—demonstrations (i.e.,, example input–output pairs). In this iter-\n6\n\nPreprint\nation of DSPy,, we focus on demonstrations and find that simple rejection-sampling-like approaches\ncan help bootstrap highly effective multi-stage systems.\nConsider the simplest non-trivial teleprompter in DSPy,, BootstrapFewShot (simplified pseudocode\nin Appendix E.1). This teleprompter will simulate a teacher program (or,, if unset,, the zero-shot\nversion of the program being compiled) on some training inputs,, possibly one or more times with\na high temperature. When running in compile mode,, multi-stage traces are tracked transparently\nand in a thread-safe fashion throughout execution. The program’s metric is used to filter for multi-\nstage traces that together help the pipeline pass the metric. We thus obtain potential labels for all\nsignatures in the program by throwing away the bad examples and using the good examples as\npotential demonstrations,, though these design decisions are under user control.\nWhile LMs can be highly unreliable,, we find they can be rather efficient at searching the space\nof solutions for multi-stage designs. A well-decomposed program can typically find at least a few\ntraining examples where the LM can pass the constraints enforced by the signatures and metrics,,\nallowing us to bootstrap iteratively if needed.\nStage 2: Parameter Optimization Now each parameter has a discrete set of candidates: demon-\nstrations,, instructions,, etc. Many hyperparameter tuning algorithms (e.g.,, random search or Tree-\nstructured Parzen Estimators as in HyperOpt (Bergstra et al.,, 2013) and Optuna (Akiba et al.,, 2019))\ncan be applied for selection among candidates. We report simplified implementations of DSPy’s\nBootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch andBootstrapFewShotWithOptuna in Appendix E.2 and\nAppendix E.3.\nAnother type of optimization is finetuning withBootstrapFinetune ,, where the demonstrations are\nused to update the LM’s weights for each predictor. When this is applied,, the LM parameter of each\nmodule is updated to the new LM weights. Typically,, we are optimizing average quality using the\nmetric with cross-validation over the training set or a validation set. This is applicable even with no\nlabels for any stages,, depending on the nature of metric.\nStage 3: Higher-Order Program Optimization A different type of optimization that the DSPy\ncompiler supports is modifying the control flow of the program. One of the simplest forms of\nthese is ensembles,, which we use in the case studies in this work. An ensemble will bootstrap\nmultiple copies of the same program,, and then replace the program with a new one that runs them\nall in parallel and reduces their predictions into one with a custom function (e.g.,, majority voting).\nIn future work,, this stage can easily accommodate techniques for more dynamic (i.e.,, test-time)\nbootstrapping as well as automatic backtracking-like logic.\n5 G OALS OF EVALUATION\nProgramming frameworks can be evaluated along many dimensions: computational efficiency,, de-\nveloper efficiency,, intuitiveness of the code and concepts,, and so forth. In this paper,, we focus on\nperhaps the most pressing issue for current LM pipelines: the role of hand-written,, task-specific\nprompts in achieving performant systems. Our evaluations seek to test the following hypotheses:\nH1With DSPy,, we can replace hand-crafted prompt strings with concise and well-defined\nmodules,, without reducing quality or expressive power.\nH2Parameterizing the modules and treating prompting as an optimization problem makes\nDSPy better at adapting to different LMs,, and it may outperform expert-written prompts.\nH3The resulting modularity makes it possible to more thoroughly explore complex pipelines\nthat have useful performance characteristics or that fit nuanced metrics.\nOur evaluation will explore these hypotheses using diverse task–program pairs. We hope this begins\na shift from underspecified questions like “how do different LMs compare on GSM8K” toward “how\nthey compare on GSM8K with program P when compiled with strategy S”,, which is a well-defined\nand reproducible run. Ultimately,, our goal is to reduce the role of artful prompt construction in\nmodern AI in favor of the development of new modular,, composable programs and optimizers.\n7\n\nPreprint\nTable 1: Results with in-context learning on GSM8K math word problems. Each row represents\na separate pipeline: the module in the Program column is compiled against the examples in the\nTraining set. The programs,, compilers,, and (small) training sets are defined in Section 6. Rows with\nensemble build on the immediately preceding row. Notably,, all programs in this table are expressed\nby composing two to four DSPy modules and teleprompters. Compiling the correct modules ,, instead\nof string prompts,, improves different LMs from 4–20% accuracy to 49–88% accuracy.\nGPT-3.5 Llama2-13b-chat\nProgram Compilation Training Dev Test Dev Test\nvanillanone n/a 24.0 25.2 7.0 9.4\nfewshot trainset 33.1 – 4.3 –\nbootstrap trainset 44.0 – 28.0 –\nbootstrap ×2trainset 64.7 61.7 37.3 36.5\n+ensemble trainset 62.7 61.9 39.0 34.6\nCoTnone n/a 50.0 – 26.7 –\nfewshot trainset 63.0 – 27.3 –\nfewshot +humanCoT 78.6 72.4 34.3 33.7\nbootstrap trainset 80.3 72.9 43.3 –\n+ensemble trainset 88.3 81.6 43.7 –\nreflectionnone n/a 65.0 – 36.7 –\nfewshot trainset 71.7 – 36.3 –\nbootstrap trainset 83.0 76.0 44.3 40.2\n+ensemble trainset 86.7 – 49.0 46.9\n6 C ASE STUDY : M ATH WORD PROBLEMS\nWe evaluate on the popular GSM8K dataset with grade school math questions (Cobbe et al.,, 2021).\nWe sample 200 and 300 question–answer pairs from the official training set for training and develop-\nment,, respectively. Our final evaluations use the 1.3k official test set examples. We report extensive\ncomparisons on the development set to avoid overfitting on test. Following prior work on GSM8K,,\nwe evaluate the accuracy of the final numerical value that appears in the LM output.\nPrograms Considered For this task,, we consider three simple DSPy programs: a one-step Pre-\ndict module ( vanilla ),, a two-step ChainOfThought module ( CoT),, and finally a multi-stage Com-\nparerOfThoughts module ( ThoughtReflection ). These are fully defined by the following code:\n1vanilla = dspy.Predict(""question -> answer"") # GSM8K Program ‘vanilla‘\n2\n3CoT = dspy.ChainOfThought(""question -> answer"") # GSM8K Program ‘CoT‘\n1class ThoughtReflection(dspy.Module):\n2def __init__(self,, num_attempts):\n3 self.predict = dspy.ChainOfThought(""question -> answer"",, n=num_attempts)\n4 self.compare = dspy.MultiChainComparison(’question -> answer’,, M=num_attempts)\n5\n6def forward(self,, question):\n7 completions = self.predict(question=question).completions\n8 return self.compare(question=question,, completions=completions)\n9\n10reflection = ThoughtReflection(num_attempts=5) # GSM8K Program ‘reflection‘\nInreflection ,, five reasoning chains are sampled from the LM (alongside their answers) and they\nare compared in parallel by a built-in MultiChainComparison module,, which generalizes Yoran\net al. (2023). This generates a new answer taking into account the patterns from the five attempts.\nCritically,, the modules used are all generic,, none is specific math problems or particular LM.\nCompiling As we discussed in Section 4,, DSPy programs can be compiled into new,, optimized\nprograms. In our experiments,, we evaluate the programs zero-shot (no compiling) as well as a\nnumber of strategies for compiling. Our simplest compiler is LabeledFewShot :\n1fewshot = dspy.LabeledFewShot(k=8).compile(program,, trainset=trainset)\nHere,,program can be any DSPy module. This simply samples k=8random demonstrations from the\ntrainset for the fields common to the training examples and the signature(s),, in this case,, question\nandanswer ,, but not the reasoning for instance. We report the average of 3–5 runs (depending on the\nsetting) when applying such random sampling.\n8\n\nPreprint\nNext,, we also consider bootstrapping few-shot examples with random search:\n1tp = BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch(metric=gsm8k_accuracy)\n2bootstrap = tp.compile(program,, trainset=trainset,, valset=devset)\nThis will generate demonstration chains for examples in the training set and optimize the selection\nof demonstrations (from this set) to self-improve the program’s modules. As the name indicates,, this\nis done with random search,, treating the selection of demonstrations as a parameter to optimize.\nNext,, if desired,, this bootstrapping process can be nested in DSPy. In particular,, we can use the\noptimized bootstrap program itself to further bootstrap another program. This is relevant,, for\nexample,, whenever the original zero-shot program performs relatively poorly.\n1bootstrap2 = tp.compile(program,, teacher=bootstrap,, trainset=trainset,, valset=devset)\nAnd lastly,, we consider ensembling these bootstraps:\n1# A program that ensembles the top-7 candidate programs from a bootstrapping compiler run\n(in particular ‘bootstrap‘ or,, when applicable,, ‘bootstrap2‘) with majority voting.\n2ensemble = Ensemble(reduce_fn=dspy.majority).compile(bootstrap.programs[:7])\nGSM8K includes human reasoning chains. Above,, trainset does not include these reasoning\nchains. We also evaluate with trainset humanCoT,, which extends the examples in trainset with\nthe human reasoning string. These two datasets can be used interchangeably as the value for the\ntrainset parameter above. We note here that compiling generally runs on the order of minutes\n(or tens of minutes) as even the more expensive settings only require running the program a few\nthousand times (e.g.,, 10–20 trials over 150–300 validation examples) and they can occur in parallel.\nResults Our results are summarized in Table 1,, which includes dev results as well as our evaluation\nof promising representatives of each approach on the test set. First,, the vanilla program results\nshow that GPT-3.5 andllama2-13b-chat struggle with math word problems when they have to\npredict the answers directly,, that is,, without using a reasoning chain first. This is most pronounced\nin the absence of good demonstrations,, which can be seen in the none compilation setting (i.e.,,\nzero-shot instruction) and the fewshot setting (i.e.,, sampling random question–answer pairs). In-\nterestingly,, however,, vanilla is helped substantially by compiling with bootstrap and by iterating\nthis process into bootstrap ×2. On inspecting the prompts bootstrapped (Appendix F),, we see that\nthe prompt allows the LM to leverage the answer field for reasoning first,, which is permitted as the\nmetric extracts the final numerical value for evaluation.\nNext,, we consider the CoTprogram. While the expert human reasoning chains ( +humanCoT) provide\na large boost when available,, we can match or surpass this using bootstrap ,, substantiating our\nhypothesis that DSPy can cut the need for hand-crafted prompts. Beyond this,, we see that the\nreflection program,, while only a few lines longer than the others,, is a clear winner,, though CoTis\nquite effective with ensemble . Overall,, the bootstrap compilation procedure leads to large gains\nfor every program,, across both LMs. Indeed,, all programs in this table are expressed by composing\ntwo to four DSPy modules and teleprompters,, and they reveal overall that—in the new paradigm\nprescribed by DSPy—it’s composing the right generic modules ,, rather than manipulating string\nprompts,, that improves different LMs from 4–20% accuracy to 49–88% accuracy.\nWe can informally compare with the following. Zhang et al. (2022) reports 48% for\ntext-davinci-002 ,, which aligns closely with our llama2-13b-chat results,, and reports 59.4%\nwith codex when employing a manual CoT approach and 62.8% with an automatic CoT method.\nWang et al. (2022b) report 57% for CoT prompting with PaLM 540-B,, which becomes 74% upon\nadding self-consistency. The Llama2 authors (Touvron et al.,, 2023) presents 28.7% for llama2-13b ,,\n42.2% for llama2-34b ,, and 56.8% for llama2-70b . Intriguingly,, our program with the 13b variant\nof the model is competitive with their 34b-based results even though we don’t use human reasoning\nchains in our program. Zhao et al. (2023b) reports 80.8% for CoT with gpt-3.5-turbo from April\n2023. The GPT-4 authors (OpenAI,, 2023) reports that GPT-3.5 scores 57.1% and GPT-4 elevates\nthis to 92% but they note that GPT-4 was in fact pre-trained on a subset of GSM8K’s training set.\n9\n\nPreprint\n7 C ASE STUDY : COMPLEX QUESTION ANSWERING\nIn this case study,, we explore the multi-hop question answering task with the HotPotQA (Yang et al.,,\n2018) dataset in the open-domain “fullwiki” setting. For retrieval,, we use a search index of the of-\nficial Wikipedia 2017 “abstracts” dump of HotPotQA. Search is conducted by a ColBERTv2 (San-\nthanam et al.,, 2021) retriever. The HotPotQA test set is hidden,, so we reserve the official validation\nset for our testing,, and sample 1000 examples for that. We sub-divide the training set into 70%/30%\ntrain/validation splits. In the training (and thus validation) split,, we keep only examples marked as\n“hard” in the original dataset,, which matches the designation of the official validation and test sets.\nFor training and for reporting development results,, we sample 200 and 300 examples respectively.\nPrograms Considered Our simplest baseline is the vanilla program used in the previous case\nstudy on GSM8K (Sec 6); the ""question -> answer"" signature is universal enough that it will\nwork for this task (and many others) when compiled appropriately.\nOur baseline RAG program is the one given in Section 3.2 as a simple example of RAG with a\ndspy.ChainOfThought layer. We will see that this program does not excel at HotPotQA,, and this\nmotivates us to evaluate two multi-hop programs.\nTo that end,, we first test ReAct (Yao et al.,, 2022),, a multi-step agent for tool use,, which is imple-\nmented as a built-in module in DSPy. In the simplest case,, a ReAct module for a particular signature\ncan be declared as follows in DSPy:\n1react = dspy.ReAct(""question -> answer"",, tools=[dspy.Retrieve(k=1)],, max_iters=5)\nWe also test the following custom program,, which simulates the information flow in Baleen (Khattab\net al.,, 2021a) and IRRR (Qi et al.,, 2020) and has similarities to IRCoT (Trivedi et al.,, 2022).\n1class BasicMultiHop(dspy.Module):\n2def __init__(self,, passages_per_hop):\n3 self.retrieve = dspy.Retrieve(k=passages_per_hop)\n4 self.generate_query = dspy.ChainOfThought(""context,, question -> search_query"")\n5 self.generate_answer = dspy.ChainOfThought(""context,, question -> answer"")\n6\n7def forward(self,, question):\n8 context = []\n9\n10 for hop in range(2):\n11 query = self.generate_query(context=context,, question=question).search_query\n12 context += self.retrieve(query).passages\n13\n14 return self.generate_answer(context=context,, question=question)\n15\n16multihop = BasicMultiHop(passages_per_hop=3)\nCompiling For compilers,, we continue to use the ones that we used for GSM8K (see Sec 6). We\nalso consider two compositions of our teleprompters. For ReAct,, we consider bootstrapping with\nBootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch starting from an earlier bootstrap of the ReAct program.\nFor the simple multihop program,, we also consider fine-tuning with T5-Large starting from the\nearlier bootstrap of that program.\n1multihop_t5 = dspy.BootstrapFinetune(metric=answer_exact_match).compile(program,,\nteacher=bootstrap,, trainset=trainset,, target=’t5-large’)\nResults Table 2 summarizes our results. Compared with the vanilla few-shot prompting,, a chain-\nof-thought and retrieval-augmented generation ( CoTRAG) program can self-bootstrap in DSPy to\nincrease answer EM substantially. However,, this relies entirely on the ColBERTv2 retriever to find\nrelevant passages directly from the original questions,, limiting its passage recall. This is tackled in\nthereact andmultihop programs,, which will generate queries for the retriever in multiple iterative\n“hops”. Indeed,, overall,, a simple multihop program performs the best,, and in general bootstrap\nagain proves to be very effective at raising its quality relative to its fewshot variant for both LMs.\nIn particular,, we can see that bootstrap (and/orbootstrap ×2) can outperform both fewshot\nprompting (for multihop ) and expert human reasoning (for react ; adapted slightly from Yao et al.\n(2022) to our retrieval setting). Perhaps most importantly,, we can make llama2-13b-chat compet-\nitive with GPT-3.5 by simply compiling our programs.\nTo assess the finetuning capacity of DSPy,, we also evaluated the compiler multihop t5defined\nabove which produces a T5-Large (770M parameter) model. This program scores 39.3% answer\nEM and 46.0% passage accuracy on the dev set,, using only 200 labeled inputs and 800 unlabeled\n10\n\nPreprint\nTable 2: Results with in-context learning on HotPotQA multi-hop retrieval question answering. We\nreport answer exact match (Ans) and pair-retrieval accuracy (Psg). Each row represents a separate\npipeline: the module in the Program column is compiled against the examples in the Training set.\nThe programs,, compilers,, and (small) training sets are defined in the main text. For HotPotQA,, we\nuse the training set (and not dev) directly for cross-validation.∗The marked result is evaluated on\n50% of our test set due to cost.\nGPT-3.5 Llama2-13b-chat\nProgram Compiler Dev Test Dev Test\nAns Psg Ans Psg Ans Psg Ans Psg\nvanilla fewshot 34.3 n/a 31.5 n/a 27.5 n/a 21.8 n/a\nCoTRAGfewshot 36.4 36.0 29.8 34.4 34.5 36.0 28.0 34.4\nbootstrap 42.3 36.0 – – 38.3 36.0 32.9 34.4\nreactnone 20.3 – – – 20.0 – – –\n+human r 33.0 – – – 28.3 – – –\nbootstrap 31.0 – – – 24.7 – – –\nbootstrap ×2 39.0 – – – 40.0 – – –\nmultihopfewshot 36.9 38.3 31.2 40.8 34.7 32.0 31.3 30.8\nbootstrap 48.7 47.0 39.6 43.8 42.0 48.3 36.4 43.5\nensemble 54.7 – 45.6∗– 50.0 – 41.0 –\nquestions. For compiling,, we use a teacher program consisting of an ensemble (union) of two\nmultihop withllama2-13b-chat . Considering its extremely small size and local availability,, this\ncompiled program with T5-Large would impose orders of magnitude lower costs for inference than\na proprietary LM like GPT-3.5.\nOur results may be pegged against the evaluation on HotPotQA in a number of recent papers,, though\nthere is significant variation in evaluation methodology and test set samples across studies in this\nspace. Using CoT prompting,, Si et al. (2022) achieve 25.2% EM. With a “recite-and-answer” tech-\nnique that uses PaLM-62B (Chowdhery et al.,, 2022) to recite evidence passages,, Sun et al. (2022)\nachieve 26.5% EM. Wang et al. (2022a) achieve 33.8% EM and 44.6% F1 when applying self-\nconsistency for PaLM-540B. Yao et al. (2022) achieve 27.4% EM using ReAct with PaLM-540B\nand 30.8 with text-davinci-002 ,, with a tool giving it the ability for search using a Wikipedia\nAPI. They push their PaLM results to 35.1% EM by applying an additional CoT step with self-\nconsistency,, which may resemble our ensemble approach in the sense of aggregating multiple an-\nswers. Trivedi et al. (2022) reports 49% using a pipeline with code-davinci-002 LM on a sample\nof 500 HotPotQA questions.\n8 C ONCLUSION\nThis paper introduced DSPy,, a new programming model for designing AI systems using pipelines\nof pretrained LMs and other tools. We presented three new concepts introduced in this abstraction\n(DSPy signatures,, modules,, and teleprompters),, and showed in two very different case studies that\nit supports rapid development of highly effective systems that use relatively small LMs. We have\nmaintained open-source versions of this framework for close to a year. In this period,, we have seen\nand created a large number of programs that were compiled to high-quality systems by DSPy,, span-\nning tasks from information extraction to low-resource synthetic data generation. In the interest of\nspace and to maintain reasonable scope in this paper,, we leave reporting on such tasks under con-\ntrolled experimental conditions to future work. While in-context learning has proved transformative\nover the past 2–3 years of LM research,, we argue that the true expressive power in this emerging\nparadigm is in building sophisticated text transformation graphs in which composable modules and\noptimizers (teleprompters) come together to leverage LMs in more systematic and reliable ways.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Josh Purtell for suggesting the apt name “text transformation graph” for the computational\ngraph abstraction of DSPy.

For\ninstance,, the following signature generates search queries using context and an optional question:\n1class GenerateSearchQuery(dspy.Signature):\n2""""""Write a simple search query that will help answer a complex question.""""""\n3\n4context = dspy.InputField(desc=""may contain relevant facts"")\n5question = dspy.InputField()\n6query = dspy.OutputField(dtype=dspy.SearchQuery)\nUsing the above,, we can specify a complete system for the generation of a synthetic IR dataset where\nthe queries are mediated by a question generated by the LM:\n1query_gen = dspy.Predict(GenerateSearchQuery)\n2query_gen(context=""Language typology"")\n3# Out: Prediction(question=’What are the main types of language classification?’,,\nquery=’""language classification"" OR ""language typology"" -wikipedia’)\nIf questions are available,, they can be supplied as shown: querygen(context=""Language\ntypology"",, question=""What are the primary language families of South America?"") .\nAs a work in progress feature,, users can optionally specify the type of output fields as bool,, int,,\nfloat,, list ,, ordict instead of the default free-form string type,, as in contexts,, question ->\nanswerfound: bool .\nB C OMPARISON WITH EXISTING LIBRARIES LIKE LANG CHAIN AND\nLLAMA INDEX\nLangChain and LlamaIndex are perhaps the most popular library in the general space of prompting\nLMs. These libraries have a different focus compared to DSPy and they suffer internally from the\nprompt engineering challenges that DSPy aims to resolve. In particular,, whereas the goal of DSPy\nis to tackle the fundamental challenges of prompt engineering for building new LM computational\ngraphs,, LangChain and LlamaIndex generally help application developers who need pre-packaged\ncomponents and chains,, e.g.,, implementations of popular and reusable pipelines (e.g.,, particular\nagents and specific retrieval pipelines) and tools (e.g.,, connections to various databases and imple-\nmentations of long- and short-term memory for agents).\nThese off-the-shelf higher-level abstractions contrast with DSPy’s focus on introducing core com-\nposable operators. In particular,, DSPy introduces signatures (to abstract prompts),, modules (to\nabstract prompting techniques),, and teleprompters to act as optimizers for arbitrary imperative code\n(DSPy programs) that chain modules together. Its goal is to help researchers and practitioners\nbuild new LM pipelines quickly and achieve very high quality through automatic compilation (self-\nimprovement) instead of manual prompt engineering.\nIn contrast,, typical existing research implementations and existing libraries like LangChain and\nLlamaIndex are implemented using manual prompt engineering,, which is the key problem that DSPy\ntackles. We conducted an informal study to highlight this. In late September 2023,, we found\nthat the LangChain codebase contains 50 strings exceeding 1000 characters,, which are generally\nprompts,, compared to none at all in DSPy. Indeed,, a substantial number of LangChain’s Python\nfiles are singularly dedicated to task-related templating and prompt engineering with 12 prompts.py\nfiles and and 42 prompt.py files. DSPy,, on the other hand,, provides a structured framework that\nautomatically bootstraps prompts. The library itself does not contain a single hand-written prompt\ndemonstration for any tasks at the time of writing,, despite the very high quality with various LMs.\nTo review the typical forms of prompt engineering in existing libraries,, we consider the follow-\ning in LangChain. The LangChain Program-Aided Language Model Gao et al. (2023a) chain pro-\ngram uses few-shot learning,, leveraging a template that is 3982 characters long with 8 math word\nproblems (Prompt 2) and corresponding outputted programs as learning examples for the language\nmodel. LangChain also contains a prompt for SQL query tasks for each of the databases like Or-\nacle,, GoogleSQL,, DuckDB,, Crate,, and MySQL,, with the average length of these prompts at 1058\ncharacters. Other task areas such as QA with sources (Prompt B) and Graph QA also have signif-\n17\n\nPreprint\nicantly lengthy prompt templates,, with averages of 1337 and 722 characters,, respectively. While\nexpert-written prompts can be useful,, we believe that LM- and task-adaptive prompts bootstrapped\nautomatically can offer far more power (and are far more modular) than hard-coding a prompt per\ndatabase provider inside the code base. The next appendix section contains a number of prompts\ncopied from related research papers and existing libraries.\nC S AMPLE LARGE PROMPTS\nThis section highlights a few popular existing frameworks that structure prompts with extensive\nprompt engineering templates. The primary objective is to capture how many words and characters\nare used for such large multi-line prompts defined for tasks or tools and present these example\nprompts retrieved from open-sourced papers and repositories. The formatting of these example\nprompts is adapted from Gao et al. (2023a).\nTask/Tool Prompt Source Words Characters\nPrompt 1: Text-evidence checker Gao et al.

When you sleep,, you switch about every 45 minutes. This\nis to prevent a buildup of mucus. It’s called the nasal cycle.\n4 I checked: How often do your nostrils switch?\n5 I found this article: Although we don’t usually notice it,, during the nasal cycle one nostril becomes congested and thus\ncontributes less to airflow,, while the other becomes decongested. On average,, the congestion pattern switches about every\n2 hours,, according to a small 2016 study published in the journal PLOS One.\n6 Your nose’s switching time is about every 2 hours,, not 45 minutes.\n7 This disagrees with what you said.\n8\n9 (2) You said: The Little House books were written by Laura Ingalls Wilder. The books were published by HarperCollins.\n10 I checked: Who published the Little House books?\n11 I found this article: These are the books that started it all -- the stories that captured the hearts and imaginations of\nchildren and young adults worldwide. Written by Laura Ingalls Wilder and published by HarperCollins,, these beloved books\nremain a favorite to this day.\n12 The Little House books were published by HarperCollins.\n13 This agrees with what you said.\n14\n15 (3) You said: The Stanford Prison Experiment was conducted in the basement of Jordan Hall,, Stanford’s psychology building.\n16 I checked: Where was Stanford Prison Experiment conducted?\n17 I found this article: Carried out August 15-21,, 1971 in the basement of Jordan Hall,, the Stanford Prison Experiment set\nout to examine the psychological effects of authority and powerlessness in a prison environment.\n18 The Stanford Prison Experiment was conducted in Jordan Hall.\n19 This agrees with what you said.\n20\n21 (4) You said: Social work is a profession that is based in the philosophical tradition of humanism. It is an intellectual\ndiscipline that has its roots in the 1800s.\n22 I checked: When did social work have its roots?\n23 I found this article: The Emergence and Growth of the Social work Profession<br><br> Social work’s roots were planted in\nthe 1880s,, when charity organization societies (COS) were created to organize municipal voluntary relief associations and\nsettlement houses were established.\n24 Social work has its roots in the 1880s,, not 1800s.\n25 This disagrees with what you said.\n26\n27 (5) You said: The Havel-Hakimi algorithm is an algorithm for converting the adjacency matrix of a graph into its adjacency\nlist. It is named after Vaclav Havel and Samih Hakimi.\n28 I checked: What is the Havel-Hakimi algorithm?\n29 I found this article: The Havel-Hakimi algorithm constructs a special solution if a simple graph for the given degree\nsequence exists,, or proves that one cannot find a positive answer. This construction is based on a recursive algorithm.\nThe algorithm was published by Havel (1955),, and later by Hakimi (1962).\n30 Havel-Hakimi algorithm is for constructing a special solution if a simple graph for the given degree sequence exists,, or\nproving that one cannot find a positive answer,, not converting the adjacency matrix of a graph into its adjacency list.\n31 This disagrees with what you said.\n32\n33 (6) You said: ""Time of My Life"" is a song by American singer-songwriter Bill Medley from the soundtrack of the 1987 film\nDirty Dancing. The song was produced by Michael Lloyd.\n34 I checked: Who was the producer of ""(I’ve Had) The Time of My Life""?\n35 I found this article: On September 8,, 2010,, the original demo of this song,, along with a remix by producer Michael Lloyd,,\nwas released as digital files in an effort to raise money for the Patrick Swayze Pancreas Cancer Resarch Foundation at\nStanford University.\n36 ""Time of My Life"" was produced by Michael Lloyd.\n37 This agrees with what you said.\n38\n39 (7) You said: Kelvin Hopins was suspended from the Labor Party because he had allegedly sexually harassed and behaved\ninappropriately towards a Labour Party activist,, Ava Etemadzadeh.\n40 I checked: Why was Kelvin Hopins suspeneded from the Labor Party?\n41 I found this article: A former Labour MP has left the party before an inquiry into sexual harassment allegations against\nhim was able to be concluded,, the party has confirmed. Kelvin Hopkins was accused in 2017 of inappropriate physical contact\nand was suspended by the Labour party pending an investigation.This agrees with what you said.\n42 Kelvin Hopins was suspended because he had allegedly sexually harassed and behaved inappropriately towards a Labour Party\nactivist,, Ava Etemadzadeh.\n43 This agrees with what you said.\n44\n45 (8) You said: In the battles of Lexington and Concord,, the British side was led by General Thomas Smith.\n46 I checked: Who led the British side in the battle of Lexington and Concord?\n47 I found this article: Interesting Facts about the Battles of Lexington and Concord. The British were led by Lieutenant\nColonel Francis Smith. There were 700 British regulars.\n48 The British side was led by Lieutenant Colonel Francis Smith,, not General Thomas Hall.\n49 This disagrees with what you said.\n50\n51 (9) You said: {text}\n52 I checked: {query }\n53 I found this article: {evidence }\n54\nFigure 1: Example few-shot prompt using a reasoning chain for agreement model that identifies\ninconsistencies between text and evidence (Gao et al.,, 2023a).\n19\n\nPreprint\n1 Q: Olivia has $23.

Given an input question,, first create a syntactically correct MyScale query to run,, then look\nat the results of the query and return the answer to the input question.\n2 MyScale queries has a vector distance function called DISTANCE(column,, array) to compute relevance to the user’s question\nand sort the feature array column by the relevance.\n3 When the query is asking for {topk}closest row,, you have to use this distance function to calculate distance to entity’s\narray on vector column and order by the distance to retrieve relevant rows.\n4 *NOTICE*: DISTANCE(column,, array) only accept an array column as its first argument and a NeuralArray(entity) as its second\nargument. You also need a user defined function called NeuralArray(entity) to retrieve the entity’s array.\n5 Unless the user specifies in the question a specific number of examples to obtain,, query for at most {topk}results using\nthe LIMIT clause as per MyScale. You should only order according to the distance function.\n6 Never query for all columns from a table. You must query only the columns that are needed to answer the question. Wrap\neach column name in double quotes ("") to denote them as delimited identifiers.\n7 Pay attention to use only the column names you can see in the tables below. Be careful to not query for columns that do\nnot exist. Also,, pay attention to which column is in which table.\n8 Pay attention to use today() function to get the current date,, if the question involves ""today"".

No additional stimulus payments. Unlike 2020 and 2021,, there were no new stimulus\npayments for 2022 so taxpayers should not expect to get an additional payment.\n9 Some tax credits return to 2019 levels. This means that taxpayers will likely receive a significantly smaller refund\ncompared with the previous tax year. Changes include amounts for the Child Tax Credit (CTC),, the Earned Income Tax Credit\n(EITC) and the Child and Dependent Care Credit will revert to pre-COVID levels.\n10 For 2022,, the CTC is worth $2,,000 for each qualifying child. A child must be under age 17 at the end of 2022 to be a\nqualifying child. For the EITC,, eligible taxpayers with no children will get $560 for the 2022 tax year. The Child and\nDependent Care Credit returns to a maximum of $2,,100 in 2022.\n11 No above-the-line charitable deductions. During COVID,, taxpayers were able to take up to a $600 charitable donation tax\ndeduction on their tax returns. However,, for tax year 2022,, taxpayers who don’t itemize and who take the standard deduction,,\nwon’t be able to deduct their charitable contributions.\n12 More people may be eligible for the Premium Tax Credit. For tax year 2022,, taxpayers may qualify for temporarily expanded\neligibility for the premium tax credit.\n13 Eligibility rules changed to claim a tax credit for clean vehicles. Review the changes under the Inflation Reduction Act\nof 2022 to qualify for a Clean Vehicle Credit.\nFigure 8: LlamaIndex example prompt for IRS chatbot guidelines.\n26\n\nPreprint\nD M ODULES\nD.1 P REDICT\n1class Predict(dspy.Module):\n2def __init__(self,, signature,, **config):\n3 self.signature = dspy.Signature(signature)\n4 self.config = config\n5\n6 # Module Parameters.\n7 self.lm = dspy.ParameterLM(None) # use the default LM\n8 self.demonstrations = dspy.ParameterDemonstrations([])\n9\n10def forward(self,, **kwargs):\n11 lm = get_the_right_lm(self.lm,, kwargs)\n12 signature = get_the_right_signature(self.signature,, kwargs)\n13 demonstrations = get_the_right_demonstrations(self.demonstrations,, kwargs)\n14\n15 prompt = signature(demos=self.demos,, **kwargs)\n16 completions = lm.generate(prompt,, **self.config)\n17 prediction = Prediction.from_completions(completions,, signature=signature)\n18\n19 if dsp.settings.compiling is not None:\n20 trace = dict(predictor=self,, inputs=kwargs,, outputs=prediction)\n21 dspy.settings.traces.append(trace)\n22\n23 return prediction\nD.2 C HAIN OF THOUGHT\n1class ChainOfThought(dspy.Module):\n2def __init__(self,, signature):\n3\n4 # Modify signature from ‘*inputs -> *outputs‘ to ‘*inputs -> rationale,, *outputs‘.\n5 rationale_field = dspy.OutputField(prefix=""Reasoning: Let’s think step by step."")\n6 signature = dspy.Signature(signature).prepend_output_field(rationale_field)\n7\n8 # Declare a sub-module with the modified signature.\n9 self.predict = dspy.Predict(self.signature)\n10\n11def forward(self,, **kwargs):\n12 # Just forward the inputs to the sub-module.\n13 return self.predict(**kwargs)\n27\n\nPreprint\nE T ELEPROMPTERS\nE.1 B OOTSTRAP FEWSHOT\n1class SimplifiedBootstrapFewShot(Teleprompter):\n2def __init__(self,, metric=None):\n3 self.metric = metric\n4\n5def compile(self,, student,, trainset,, teacher=None):\n6 teacher = teacher if teacher is not None else student\n7 compiled_program = student.deepcopy()\n8\n9 # Step 1.

We introduce\nARES,, an Automated RAG Evaluation System ,,\nfor evaluating RAG systems along the dimen-\nsions of context relevance,, answer faithfulness,,\nand answer relevance. Using synthetic training\ndata,, ARES finetunes lightweight LM judges\nto assess the quality of individual RAG compo-\nnents. To mitigate potential prediction errors,,\nARES utilizes a small set of human-annotated\ndatapoints for prediction-powered inference\n(PPI). Across six different knowledge-intensive\ntasks in KILT and SuperGLUE,, ARES accu-\nrately evaluates RAG systems while using a\nfew hundred human annotations during evalu-\nation. Furthermore,, ARES judges remain ef-\nfective across domain shifts,, proving accurate\neven after changing the type of queries and/or\ndocuments used in the evaluated RAG systems.\nWe make our datasets and code for replication\nand deployment available at https://github.\ncom/stanford-futuredata/ARES .\n1 Introduction\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has be-\ncome a prominent approach for building user-\nfacing NLP applications,, such as systems for ques-\ntion answering (QA),, fact-checking,, and customer\nsupport (Petroni et al.,, 2021; Wang et al.,, 2019).\nTypically,, a RAG system consists of a retriever\nand a downstream language model. Given a user\nquestion,, the retriever finds relevant passages from\na corpus (e.g.,, a company’s internal knowledge\nbase) and the language model uses these passages\nto generate a response. This formulation admits a\nmultitude of choices: what retrieval model to use,,\nhow to divide the documents into retrieval chunks,,\nand how to prompt or finetune the language model\nto use the retrieved information,, to name only a few\nof the simplest design decisions.The best design for a RAG system is not neces-\nsarily universal across data domains,, corpus sizes,,\nand cost/latency budgets. To tune their own RAG\nsystems,, practitioners traditionally need hand an-\nnotations for test questions,, passages to retrieve\n(to assess the retriever),, and responses to generate,,\nlabeled specifically for their target domain. Alter-\nnatively,, they may evaluate different approaches in\nproduction by collecting human preferences that\ncompare the candidate systems. Unfortunately,,\nboth of these strategies demand high expertise and\nimpose considerable annotation costs.\nModel-based evaluation has emerged as cheap\nand automatic strategy to test generative output\nquality (Zheng et al.,, 2023). For instance,, the open-\nsource RAGAS (James and Es,, 2023) framework\nis an attempt at prompting a language model for\nevaluating the relevance of retrieved information\nand the faithfulness andaccuracy of generated re-\nsponses. Unfortunately,, such strategies currently\nrely for evaluation on a fixed set of heuristically\nhand-written prompts,, offering little adaptability to\nvarious evaluation contexts.\nTo evaluate RAG systems rapidly and accu-\nrately,, we propose ARES,, the Automated RAG\nEvaluation System. ARES is the first automated\nRAG evaluation system to generate tailored LLM\njudges for each component of a RAG pipeline,, lead-\ning to substantial boosts in evaluation precision and\naccuracy compared to existing approaches like RA-\nGAS. Furthermore,, unlike existing RAG evaluation\nsystems,, ARES provides statistical guarantees for\nits predictions by leveraging prediction-powered\ninference (PPI),, generating confidence intervals for\nits scoring. Given a particular corpus of documents\nand a RAG system,, ARES reports three evaluation\nscores: context relevance (i.e.,, is the retrieved in-\nformation pertinent to the test question),, answer\nfaithfulness (i.e.,, is the response generated by the\nlanguage model properly grounded in the retrieved\ncontext),, and answer relevance (i.e.,, is the responsearXiv:2311.09476v1  [cs.CL]  16 Nov 2023\n\nalso relevant to the question). A good RAG system\nfind relevant contexts and generates answers that\nare both faithful and relevant.\nMany existing RAG evaluation frameworks re-\nquire substantial human annotations for scoring.\nARES significantly improves data efficiency dur-\ning evaluation by only requiring three inputs: a set\nof passages from the target corpus,, a human pref-\nerence validation set of 150 annotated datapoints\nor more,, and five few-shot examples of in-domain\nqueries and answers,, which are used for prompting\nLLMs in synthetic data generation. Given the cor-\npus of in-domain passages,, ARES proceeds in three\nstages. First,, it leverages a language model to con-\nstruct a synthetic dataset of question–answer pairs,,\nderived from the passages in the corpus. Second,,\nARES defines three separate judge models to per-\nform three classification tasks (context relevance,,\nanswer faithfulness,, and answer relevance). These\njudges are lightweight models fine-tuned against a\ncontrastive learning objective. Third,, ARES ranks\nthe different RAG systems being assessed using\nprediction-powered inference (PPI; Angelopoulos\net al. 2023) to improve model-based evaluation ac-\ncuracy and provide statistical confidence intervals\nfor RAG scoring. PPI utilizes a small set of human\nannotated datapoints for computing its confidence\nintervals; we designate this annotated set as our hu-\nman preference validation set ,, which is composed\nof 150 annotated datapoints or more that designate\nboth positive and negative examples for context rel-\nevance,, answer faithfulness,, and answer relevance.\nThis work makes the following contributions.\nFirst,, we propose the ARES framework for eval-\nuating the context relevance,, answer faithfulness,,\nand answer relevance of RAG systems using only\nthe corpus passages and a human preference val-\nidation set of 150 datapoints or more. Second,,\nwe offer a novel development pipeline for fine-\ntuning lightweight LLMs on synthetically gen-\nerated queries and answers. We further bolster\nour lightweight LLM judges by using prediction-\npowered inference (PPI) and human annotations\nto provide statistical guarantees to ARES scoring\nof RAG systems. Third,, we conduct extensive\nempirical evaluations,, demonstrating that ARES\naccurately scores RAG systems across the six\nknowledge-intensive datasets in KILT and Super-\nGLUE,, beating existing automated evaluation ap-\nproaches like RAGAS by 59.29 and 14.4 percent-\nage points on average across context relevance and\nanswer relevance evaluation accuracy,, respectively.We also find that ARES consistently distinguishes\ncompetitive RAG systems that are only a few points\napart in ground-truth metrics. This precision en-\nables ARES to guide the development and compar-\nison of competitive approaches and configurations.\nWe provide the datasets and code for replicating\nand deploying ARES on Github.\n2 Related Work\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG; Guu et al.\n2020; Lewis et al. 2020; Khattab et al. 2021; Izac-\nard et al. 2022) is now a common strategy for bol-\nstering LLMs by combining them with retrieval\nsystems. Through retrieval,, RAG helps LM sys-\ntems gather domain-specific knowledge,, ground\ngenerations in factual information (Shuster et al.,,\n2021; Huo et al.,, 2023),, and offer a degree of trans-\nparency or interpretability via citing sources (Mi-\nalon et al.,, 2023).\nLLM-based evaluation techniques have emerged\nfor gauging LLM systems. This is essential for\nrapid deployment in new settings,, where it is im-\npractical to build a traditional benchmark dataset\nfrom scratch. Early attempts at this use LLMs\nout of the box,, like in MT-Bench and Chatbot\nArena (Zheng et al.,, 2023). AutoCalibrate (Liu\net al.,, 2023b) seeks to align an LLM-judge with\nhuman preferences,, leveraging a self-refinement\nprompt to iteratively improve the LLM judge.\nOther work has used LLM prompting to evaluate\nsystem quality across natural language generation\ntasks,, such as translation,, summarization,, and dia-\nlogue generation (Kocmi and Federmann,, 2023; Fu\net al.,, 2023; Liu et al.,, 2023a; Wang et al.,, 2023).\nIn the context of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks,,\nLLMs have been explored for assessing attribution\nand factuality in LLMs (Min et al.,, 2023; Gekhman\net al.,, 2023; Yue et al.,, 2023). New guidelines like\nLongEval (Krishna et al.,, 2023) and datasets like\nHagrid and ALCE (Kamalloo et al.,, 2023; Gao\net al.,, 2023) provide resources for analyzing evalu-\nating knowledge-intensive LLM pipelines.\nThe two most-closely related projects to our\nwork are EXAM (Sander and Dietz,, 2021) and RA-\nGAS (James and Es,, 2023). To evaluate RAG sys-\ntems,, the EXAM metric estimates how many exam\nquestions a reader (simulated as a QA system) can\nanswer correctly based on the generated response.\nThe EXAM metric requires a set of queries with\nseveral associated sub-questions each,, which adds\na substantial burden that ARES does not require.\n\nRAGAS is a recent evaluation framework based on\na handful of simple hand-written prompts. These\nheuristic prompts offer little adaptability to new\nRAG evaluation settings (e.g.,, new corpora) and,,\nas we show in our evaluation,, substantially under-\nperforms ARES.\n3 ARES\nThe ARES evaluation framework proceeds in three\nstages,, which we illustrate in Figure 1. ARES\nrequires three inputs for the pipeline: a set of pas-\nsages from the target corpus,, a human preference\nvalidation set of 150 annotated datapoints or more,,\nand five few-shot examples of in-domain queries\nand answers,, which are used for prompting LLMs\nin synthetic data generation. With our inputs pre-\npared,, we begin by generating synthetic queries\n(and their answers) from the passages in the target\ncorpus. We then use these query–passage–answer\ntriples to train our LLM judges (e.g.,, for detecting\nanswer relevance). Subsequently,, we apply these\njudges to any RAG system,, scoring a sample of its\nin-domain query-document-answer triples,, and use\nprediction-powered inference (PPI) with our hu-\nman preference validation set to reliably estimate\na confidence interval for the quality of each RAG\nsystem.\n3.1 LLM Generation of Synthetic Dataset\nWe generate synthetic queries and answers from\nthe corpus passages using generative LLMs. The\ngenerated data represent both positive and negative\nexamples of query–passage–answer triples (e.g.,,\nrelevant/irrelevant passages and correct/incorrect\nanswers). For generation,, the LLM uses our in-\nput set of few-shot examples with in-domain pas-\nsages mapped to in-domain queries and answers;\nthe model then generates a synthetic question and\nanswer from a given in-domain passage,, allowing\nus to create both positive and negative training ex-\namples. We include example prompts for generat-\ning synthetic queries and answers in A.5.\nFor creating our synthetic data,, we primarily rely\non FLAN-T5 XXL (discussed in subsection 4.1).\nARES works well with this model (see section 5)\nbut our system can ultimately use another high-\nquality model for generating synthetic queries and\nanswers. To filter out low-quality queries,, we verify\nthat a given query can retrieve its original passage\nas the top result using its retriever system. The\nfiltering approach has been used in previous workto isolate high-quality synthetic queries (Dai et al.,,\n2022; Saad-Falcon et al.,, 2023).\nTo generate negatives for fine-tuning our LLM\njudges,, we rely on two novel strategies,, generating\nthe same number of negatives with each strategy:\n1.Weak Negative Generation : For context rel-\nevance negatives,, we randomly sample in-\ndomain passages unrelated to a given syn-\nthetic query. For answer faithfulness and\nanswer relevance negatives,, we randomly\nsample synthetically-generated answers from\nother passages,, which were created using\nFLAN-T5 XXL.\n2.Strong Negative Generation : For context\nrelevance negatives,, we randomly sample in-\ndomain passages from the same document as\nthe gold passage. For datasets in which mul-\ntiple passages are not available for the same\ndocument,, we use BM25 to retrieve the top-\n10 passages similar to the passage and sample\nfrom them for our context relevance strong\nnegatives. For answer faithfulness and an-\nswer relevance negatives,, we prompt FLAN-\nT5 XXL (discussed in Section 4.1) to gener-\nate a contradictory answer using the few-shot\nprompt in Section A.4.\nIn total,, the number of negatives generated\nequals the number of positives generated for eval-\nuating context relevance and answer relevance in\nRAG systems.\n3.2 Preparing LLM Judges\nTo prepare our RAG evaluation judges,, we use our\nsynthetic dataset to fine-tune several lightweight\nLLMs. We fine-tune our LLM judges to evaluate\nthe RAG systems across three different capabilities,,\neach of which are often analyzed by researchers\nand practitioners to gauge RAG system perfor-\nmance (Chen et al.,, 2023; James and Es,, 2023):\n1.Context Relevance : Is the passage returned\nrelevant for answering the given query?\n2.Answer Faithfulness : Is the answer gener-\nated faithful to the retrieved passage? Or does\nit contain hallucinated or extrapolated state-\nments beyond the passage?\n3.Answer Relevance : Is the answer generated\nrelevant given the query and retrieved pas-\nsage?\n\nFigure 1: Overview of ARES : As inputs,, the ARES pipeline requires an in-domain passage set,, a human preference\nvalidation set of 150 annotated datapoints or more,, and five few-shot examples of in-domain queries and answers,,\nwhich are used for prompting LLMs in synthetic data generation. To prepare our LLM judges for evaluation,, we\nfirst generate synthetic queries and answers from the corpus passages. Using our generated training triples and\na constrastive learning framework,, we fine-tune an LLM to classify query–passage–answer triples across three\ncriteria: context relevance,, answer faithfulness,, and answer relevance. Finally,, we use the LLM judge to evaluate\nRAG systems and generate confidence bounds for the ranking using PPI and the human preference validation set.\nFor each of the key metrics,, a separate LLM with\na classifier head is fine-tuned to classify positive\nand negative examples using a binary classification\ntraining objective. For each concatenated query-\ndocument-answer,, a single LLM judge must clas-\nsify the triple as positive or negative for a specific\nmetric: context relevance,, answer faithfulness,, or\nanswer relevance. For fine-tuning,, we use our hu-\nman preference validation set to evaluate model\nimprovement after each epoch. We continue fine-\ntuning until we have three epochs with no improve-\nment in validation set loss.\n3.3 Ranking RAG Systems with Confidence\nIntervals\nOnce we have prepared our LLM judges,, we need\nto use them to score and rank the competing RAG\nsystems. To do this,, ARES samples the in-domain\nquery-document-answer triples produced by each\nRAG approach,, and the judges will label each triple,,\npredicting their context relevance,, answer faithful-\nness,, and answer relevance. By averaging the in-\ndividual predicted labels for each in-domain triple,,\nwe calculate the RAG system performance across\neach of the three metrics.\nIn principle,, we could simply report these aver-\nage scores as quality metrics for each RAG system.\nHowever,, these scores reflect entirely unlabeled\ndata with predictions from a synthetically-trained\nLLM judge,, and hence may exhibit a degree of\nnoise. As an extreme alternative,, we could use\njust the small human preference validation set dis-\ncussed previously for evaluation,, reporting the ex-tent to which each RAG system agrees with (or\ndeviates from) the human annotations. However,,\nan entirely annotation-based evaluation approach\nwould require labeling outputs from each RAG sys-\ntems separately,, which can be costly both in terms\nof time and financing.\nTo combine the benefits of both,, and hence\nboost the precision of the evaluation,, ARES uses\nprediction-powered inference (PPI) to predict the\nsystem scores. PPI is a recent statistical method\nthat tightens the confidence interval on the predic-\ntions on a small set of annotated datapoints (i.e.,,\nour validation set) by leveraging predictions on a\nmuch larger set of non-annotated datapoints. PPI\ncan leverage both the labeled datapoints and the\nARES judge predictions on the non-annotated dat-\napoints to construct tighter confidence intervals for\nour RAG system’s performance.\nTo do this,, PPI uses the LLM judges on the hu-\nman preference validation set to learn a rectifier\nfunction for constructing a confidence set of the\nML model’s performance,, using each ML predic-\ntion in the larger non-annotated dataset. The confi-\ndence set can then be used to create a tighter confi-\ndence interval for the average outcome of the ML\nmodel’s performance (e.g. its context relevance,,\nanswer faithfulness,, or answer relevance accuracy\nindividually). By bolstering the human preference\nvalidation set with the much larger set of datapoints\nwith ML predictions,, PPI can develop reliable con-\nfidence intervals for ML model performance that\nbeat previous classical inference approaches.\nThe PPI rectifier function allows us to mitigate\n\nthe errors of the LLM judge and generate confi-\ndence bounds for the success and failure rates of the\nRAG system,, estimating context relevance,, answer\nfaithfulness,, and answer relevance performances.\nAdditionally,, PPI allows us to estimate confidence\nintervals with a selected level of probability; for our\nexperiments,, we use a standard 95% alpha (proba-\nbility) for our confidence interval.\nWith the accuracy confidence interval for each\ncomponent of the RAG,, we find the midpoint of\neach confidence interval and use the midpoints to\nrank the RAG systems. With our ranking,, we can\ncompare different RAG systems,, as well as differ-\nent configurations of the same RAG system,, to find\nthe optimal approach for a given domain.\n4 Experiments\n4.1 Models\nFor our fine-tuned judges,, ARES relies on generat-\ning cheap but quality synthetic queries and answers\nusing LLMs. For generating our synthetic datasets,,\nwe use FLAN-T5 XXL (Chung et al.,, 2022). We se-\nlected DeBERTa-v3-Large (He et al.,, 2021) for our\nfine-tuned LLM judge. Our fine-tuned LLM judges\nallows us to rank RAG systems without relying on\nexternal APIs,, solely using few-shot prompts and\ndeployable LLMs on commercial GPUs.\nFor our in-context learning baseline,, we use Ope-\nnAI’s gpt-3.5-turbo-16k (Brown et al.,, 2020) in a\nzero/few-shot setting. For similarity search over\nin-domain passages,, we use FAISS IndexFlatL2 for\nindexing (Johnson et al.,, 2019) and OpenAI’s text-\nembedding-ada-002 for generating embeddings.\nWe use simlarity search over in-domain passages\nto filter our synthetic queries that cannot retrieve\nthe passage from which they were generated.\n4.2 Datasets\nOur core experimental goal is to provide a rich pic-\nture of where ARES can be applied effectively.\nTo test across multiple types of queries,, docu-\nments,, and answers,, we selected all the datasets\nfrom the widely-used KILT and SuperGLUE bench-\nmarks in which we assess that using RAG systems\nis appropriate. From the KILT datasets (Petroni\net al.,, 2021),, we use Natural Questions (NQ),,\nHotpotQA,, FEVER,, and Wizards of Wikipedia\n(WoW) (Kwiatkowski et al.,, 2019; Yang et al.,,\n2018; Akhtar et al.,, 2023; Dinan et al.,, 2018). Each\ndataset uses Wikipedia passages but the queries\nand answers offer a range of applications. BothNQ and HotpotQA feature direct questions and ex-\npect short answers but NQ uses single passages\nfor reasoning while HotpotQA requires multiple\npassages for reasoning. Furthermore,, FEVER fo-\ncuses on fact-verification,, determining if a passage\nsupports or refutes a given statement,, and expects\nan output of ""SUPPORTS"" or ""REFUTES"". WoW\nseeks to evaluate dialogue agents by mapping user\ndialogue to relevant Wikipedia passages before a\nchatbot generates a paragraph-length chat response\nincorporating passage knowledge.\nFrom the SuperGLUE datasets (Wang et al.,,\n2019),, we use the MultiRC and ReCoRD datasets\n(Khashabi et al.,, 2018; Zhang et al.,, 2018). Mul-\ntiRC focuses on direct questions for seven different\ndomains (News,, Wikipedia articles,, articles on so-\nciety/law/justice,, articles on history/anthropology,,\nelementary school science textbooks,, 9/11 reports,,\nand fiction). ReCoRD focuses on determining the\nplaceholder entity in a statement,, focusing on news\narticles from CNN and the Daily Mail. For Mul-\ntiRC and ReCoRD,, we create open-domain ver-\nsions of their tasks. For MultiRC,, we perform re-\ntrieval over its seven sets of domain passages while\nfor ReCoRD,, we perform retrieval over its news\narticle passages.\nThe efficacy of ARES relies on its ability to rank\ndifferent RAG systems while only using a human\npreference validation set and a domain-targeted\nLLM judge. To test the limits of ARES,, we need\nto simulate the existence of many RAG systems\nthat are separated by small accuracy margins on\nour evaluation metrics. To generate mock RAG\nsystems,, we create their artificial query-passage-\nanswer triples,, in which we empirically know the\npositive and negative examples of the mock RAG\nsystem. We generate these mock splits of the given\ndatasets by selecting:\n•The positive and negative query-passage\nmatches for context relevance\n•The positive and negative query-passage-\nanswer matches for answer relevance\nFor our positive query-passage-answer triples,,\nwe can simply use the KILT and SuperGLUE ex-\namples without any alteration. For gathering nega-\ntive query-passage pairs and query-passage-answer\ntriples,, we randomly sample passages and answers\nfrom either: the same Wikipedia document or an en-\ntirely random Wikipedia document. This sampling\nallows us to artificially create mock RAG systems\n\nfor testing ARES. By sampling both related and\nunrelated documents/answers,, we hope to better\ngauge the efficacy of ARES in judging RAG out-\nputs. We include examples of our evaluation set in\nA.6.\nWe do not evaluate answer faithfulness for KILT\nand SuperGLUE datasets since we do not have\nhuman-annotated hallucinated answers to use for\nevaluation. However,, the ARES framework and\ncode base allow for answer faithfulness evaluation\nas well.\nUsing the validation subsets for each KILT\nand SuperGLUE dataset,, we create nine different\ndataset splits,, ranging from 70% success rate to\n90% success rate for each of the evaluated RAG\ncriteria; each dataset is separated by 2.5% accuracy\npoints (e.g. 70.0%,, 72.5%,, 75.0%,, . . . ,, 90.0%).\nEach split also represents a different mock RAG\nsystem. Since we know the success percentages of\neach dataset split,, we know the appropriate rank-\ning of each mock RAG system. This allows us to\ntest ARES success at both scoring and ranking the\nmock RAG systems appropriately across the three\nevaluation criteria.\n4.3 Metrics\nTo calculate the correlation between the correct\nranking and the ARES ranking,, we use the Kendall\nrank correlation coefficient or Kendall’s tau:\nτ=(#of concordant pairs )−(#of discordant pairs )\n#of pairs total\n(1)\nConcordant pairs are defined as two ordinal val-\nues in the ranking where the earlier value in the\nsequence is lower than the later value in the se-\nquence. Discordant pairs are defined as two ordinal\nvalues in the ranking where the earlier value in\nthe sequence is greater than the later value in the\nsequence.\nIn development,, researchers and engineers\nwill be comparing different RAG configurations\nthrough individual pairwise comparisons of model\nchoices,, retriever selection,, and document prepro-\ncessing. We want to make sure that ARES has sat-\nisfactory accuracy in pairwise comparisons across\na variety of performance gaps between RAG sys-\ntems. Kendall’s tau is explicitly designed for mea-\nsuring the accuracy of such pairwise comparisons,,\ncalculating the correlation between a perfectly ac-\ncurate pairwise ranking and an experimental pair-\nwise ranking. As a result,, Kendall’s tau remainsa popular and widespread metric used in informa-\ntion retrieval,, allowing developers to evaluate rank-\ning systems empirically. Therefore,, we believe\nKendall’s tau and micro-F1 (prediction accuracy)\nprovide meaningful metrics for testing the efficacy\nof ARES as a RAG evaluation system.\n5 Results & Analysis\n5.1 ARES Ranking\nOur goal is to explore whether ARES is more effec-\ntive at scoring and ranking RAG systems than the\ncurrent popular automated RAG evaluation system,,\nRAGAS (James and Es,, 2023). In Table 1,, we also\nevaluate a few-shot prompted GPT-3.5 judge. We\ncompare RAGAS and the few-shot judge against\nARES,, which as discussed before uses syntheti-\ncally fine-tuned LLM (DeBERTa-v3-Large). For\nthe few-shot GPT-3.5 judge,, we provide few-shot\nexamples for guiding predictions; the prompts are\nincluded in Appendices A.1,, A.2,, and A.3. For\nboth ARES and the GPT-3.5 judge baseline,, we\naugment the LLM with PPI,, using a 300-datapoint\nhuman preference validation set to rectify the ML\npredictions and produce confidence intervals for\nscoring.\nAcross almost all settings across the datasets\nfrom KILT and SuperGLUE (i.e.,, NQ,, HotpotQA,,\nWoW,, FEVER,, MultiRC,, and ReCoRD),, ARES\nprovides a more accurate ranking of RAG sys-\ntems than RAGAS. ARES averages a Kendall’s\ntau0.065 higher for context relevance and0.132\nhigher for answer relevance than RAGAS . Addi-\ntionally,, the LLM-judge is substantially more accu-\nrate than RAGAS at predicting context relevance\nand answer relevance of a query-passage-answer\ntriple. For context relevance,, ARES with a fine-\ntuned LLM-judge is 59.9 percentage points higher\nthan RAGAS while for answer relevance,, our sys-\ntem is 14.4 percentage points higher than RAGAS .\nOverall,, ARES provides a more accurate system for\nautomatically evaluating RAG configurations than\nRAGAS by leveraging domain-adaptive techniques\nfor prompting and training as well as utilizing PPI\nto bolster model predictions.\nFurthermore,, ARES provides a more accurate\nranking of the RAG systems than the GPT-3.5\njudge,, averaging a Kendall’s tau 0.06 higher over\nboth context relevance and answer relevance. Be-\ntween the judge configurations,, the fine-tuned LLM\njudge of ARES can more precisely distinguish be-\ntween RAG systems and guide configuration de-\n\nARES Ranking of Pseudo RAG Systems\nNQ HotpotQA WoW FEVER MultiRC ReCoRD\nC.R A.R.

RAGAS also uses\nGPT-3.5 as its judge but it uses few-shot prompts that are not targeted for each evaluation domain. Overall,, we\nfound that ARES ranked RAG systems more accurately than RAGAS and GPT-3.5 across all the explored datasets.\nThe Kendall’s tau for ARES was 0.065 higher on average for scoring context relevance and0.132 higher on average\nfor scoring answer relevance than RAGAS. We selected GPT-3.5 instead of GPT-4 due to the high financial costs of\nrunning GPT-4 over the tens of thousands of queries,, documents,, and answers for each dataset; the lower financial\ncosts required to run. For PPI in both ARES and the GPT-3.5 judge,, we used 300 human annotations for our human\npreference validation set. The prompts used for the GPT-3.5 judges are included in Sections A.1,, A.2,, and A.3.\ncisions surrounding document splitting,, retriever\nselection,, and generative LLM choice. However,,\nwhile the fine-tuned LLM judge had a higher\nKendall’s tau on average,, the GPT-3.5 judge is\nmore readily deployable and does not require any\nadditional fine-tuning. The GPT-3.5 judge does\ncome with its own querying costs,, which can vary\nbased on the date of querying as well as the total\ntokens used in evaluation.\n5.2 Limits of PPI\nPrediction-powered inference (PPI) relies on a hu-\nman preference validation set for calculating its\nrectifier function ,, which allows it to gauge the pre-\ndiction error of the ARES LLM judge and generate\ntighter confidence intervals for estimated RAG per-\nformance (see subsection 3.3 for more information\non PPI). Additional labeled datapoints tightens the\nconfidence interval of PPI: the more labeled dat-\napoints,, the more accurate PPI is in calculating\nthe rectifier function. We wanted to explore just\nhow little human annotations are needed for PPI,,\nand thus ARES,, to be effective at comparing RAG\nconfigurations.\nIn Table 2,, we analyze the efficacy of ARES\nwith different labeled datapoint counts for PPI.

We\nuse the same experimental set-up as described in subsec-\ntion 4.2. We find that below about 100-150 datapoints\nin the human preference validation set,, ARES cannot\nmeaningfully distinguish between the alternate RAG\nsystems based on their accuracies in context relevance\nand answer relevance (C.R. and A.R.,, respectively).\n\nNQ,, MultiRC,, and ReCoRD,, we found that the\nKendall’s tau for ARES drops below 0.75 on aver-\nage when using less than 100 datapoints for con-\ntext relevance and answer relevance categorization.\nWe found the same pattern over the broader set of\ndatasets explored,, regardless of query,, document,,\nor answer type. Therefore,, we recommend using\nARES with a sufficient human preference valida-\ntion set for PPI (e.g. a set greater than 150-200\ndatapoints).\n5.3 Strengths and Limits of Cross-Domain\nApplications\nThe generalizability of the LLM judge used in\nARES is critical for deploying our framework in\nspecialized domains,, particularly domains where\nin-domain queries,, documents,, and answers are dif-\nficult to gather. Therefore,, we wanted to test how\nthe LLM judges used in ARES would be affected\nby three domain shifts:\n1.Change in query type from training to test (e.g.\nswitch from questions to statements) by using\na judge fine-tuned for NQ to evaluate RAG\nsystems on FEVER and vice-versa.\n2.Change in document type from training to test\n(e.g. switch from Wikipedia passages to news\narticles) by using a judge fine-tuned for NQ to\nevaluate RAG systems on MultiRC and vice-\nversa.\n3.Change in both query and document type from\ntraining to test (e.g. switch from Wikipedia-\nbased QA dataset to news article-based state-\nment dataset) by using a judge fine-tuned for\nNQ to evaluate RAG systems on ReCoRD and\nvice-versa.\nIn Table 3,, we found that the fine-tuned LLM\njudges used in ARES proved successful in cross-\ndomain applications. Across all settings,, we found\nthat LLM judges in ARES had strong generaliz-\nability,, even when only using 300 datapoints in our\nhuman preference validation set for PPI. Further-\nmore,, we found that even when the LLM judge’s ac-\ncuracy suffered in cross-domain applications,, PPI\nhelped mitigate the loss in accuracy and still allow\nARES to be successful. Additional examples for\nPPI also continued to boost cross-domain ARES\nperformance in subsequent tests.\nWhile LLM judges in ARES were successful\nin cross-domain applications for KILT and Super-GLUE,, LLM judges are unable to generalize when\nmaking more drastic shifts in domain,, such as:\n•Switching languages (e.g. English to Spanish,,\nGerman,, and other languages)\n•Switching from text to code (e.g. questions\n+ passages to coding functions + documenta-\ntion)\n•Switching from retrieving text to extraction of\nentities,, webpages,, or citations\nTo test cross-lingual transfer,, we used the\nXGLUE datasets (Liang et al.,, 2020); a LLM judge\nfine-tuned on NQ achieved a Kendall’s tau of 0.33\nover both context relevance and answer relevance\nscoring for XGLUE. To test text-to-code,, we used\nCodeSearchNet (Husain et al.,, 2019); an LLM\njudge fine-tuned on NQ achieved a Kendall’s tau\nof 0.28 over both context relevance and answer\nrelevance scoring for CodeSearchNet. To test ex-\ntraction task generalizability,, we used T-Rex from\nKILT (Elsahar et al.,, 2018; Petroni et al.,, 2021); an\nLLM judge fine-tuned on NQ achieved a Kendall’s\ntau of 0.38 over both context relevance and answer\nrelevance scoring for T-Rex. Each of these cross-\ndomain shifts require in-domain passages and few-\nshot query examples for reconfiguring LLM judges\nin ARES.\n5.4 GPT-4 for Human-Labeling\nARES relies on human-annotations for utilizing\nPPI alongside the LLM judge. However,, we wanted\nto test if GPT-4 generated labels could replace the\nhuman preference validation set altogether,, allow-\ning us to solely rely on few-shot examples for gen-\nerating context relevance,, answer faithfulness,, and\nanswer relevance annotations needed for PPI.\nIn Table 4,, we explored if GPT-4 labels could\nreplace human labels entirely,, allowing us to only\nneed human annotations for few-shot examples.\nSince GPT-4 labels could be generated relatively\ncheaply,, we created 500 labels for each of our ex-\nplored datasets (e.g. NQ,, FEVER,, and MultiRC).\nIn ARES,, we found GPT-4 generated labels are\nnot as useful as human labels,, leading to a drop in\nKendall’s tau by 0.05 to 0.3 across most settings.\nHowever,, additional generation of GPT-4 could\ncontinue to tighten the gap in performance between\nmachine and human annotations by tightening the\nconfidence interval produced by PPI. By combin-\ning further label generation with better prompts,,\n\nARES Cross-Domain Ranking of Pseudo RAG Systems\nNQ to\nFEVERFEVER to\nNQNQ to\nMultiRCMultiRC to\nNQNQ to\nReCoRDReCoRD to\nNQ\nC.R.

We found that for both context relevance and answer relevance\n(C.R. and A.R. in the table,, respectively),, fine-tuned LLM judges showed strong generalizability across domains\nwhen changing query type (e.g. NQ and FEVER),, document type (e.g. NQ and MultiRC),, or both (e.g. NQ and\nReCoRD). For PPI,, we used 300 labeled examples for our human preference validation set but also found that\nadditional examples further improved the performance of ARES. Furthermore,, we found that even in scenarios\nwhere the fine-tuned LLM judge’s accuracy significantly dropped out-of-domain (e.g. answer relevance for NQ\nto FEVER),, PPI mitigated the decrease in judge performance.

In the experiments,, we\ngenerated 500 GPT-4 labels as replacements for human labeling using few-shot prompts (see Sections A.1,, A.2,,\nand A.3). While GPT-4 generated labels decreased Kendall’s tau in most settings by 0.05 to 0.30,, the ability to\ncheaply produce GPT-4 generated labels significantly reduces the cost of annotation,, cutting it from hundreds of\nannotations to less than ten for few-shot prompts. Additionally,, the efficacy of PPI continues improving as we\ngenerate more GPT-4 generated labels. In the table,, we define PPI range as the number of percentage points from\nthe lower number to the upper number of the PPI confidence bounding. Additionally,, we use the fine-tuned LLM\njudge (DeBERTa-v3-Large) for evaluation.\n\nwe expect further improvements in ARES by solely\nusing GPT-4 generated labels instead of human\nannotations.\n6 Future Work\nOur experimental results with ARES inspired sev-\neral new directions for future research:\n•Improved generation of GPT-4 labels as a re-\nplacement for human labeling in ARES\n•Creating more robust techniques for synthetic\ndatasets used in fine-tuning lightweight LLM\njudges\n•Developing a foundation model for RAG eval-\nuation to use as a starting checkpoint for the\nfine-tuned LLM judge in ARES\n•Utilizing logits in LLM judge prediction to\nimprove PPI confidence intervals\n•Testing more sophisticated LLMs as fine-\ntuned judge for ARES\n7 Conclusion\nIn this work,, we present ARES,, a novel automated\nevaluation framework for retrieval-augmented gen-\neration (RAG) that specializes to the evaluation\ndomain. ARES offers a novel training pipeline for\nfine-tuning lightweight LLM judges on syntheti-\ncally generated queries and answers. With its LLM\njudges,, ARES can evaluate each component of a\nRAG system separately to help improve system\nunderstanding and create targeted solutions. Addi-\ntionally,, PPI allows ARES to improve the precision\nand accuracy of the LLM judge’s scoring by com-\nbining high-quality ML predictions with a human\npreference validation set. By combining PPI with\nthe specialized LLM judge,, ARES evaluates RAG\nsystems with minimal human annotations for eval-\nuation. For the six different datasets in KILT and\nSuperGLUE requiring RAG-based solutions,, we\nfound that ARES can accurately score and rank\nRAG systems based on context relevance,, answer\nfaithfulness,, and answer relevance scores,, beating\nthe existing RAGAS automated evaluation frame-\nwork. Finally,, we discuss several avenues for future\nwork building on our experiments with ARES.References\nMubashara Akhtar,, Rami Aly,, Christos\nChristodoulopoulos,, Oana Cocarascu,, Zhijiang Guo,,\nArpit Mittal,, Michael Schlichtkrull,, James Thorne,,\nand Andreas Vlachos,, editors. 2023.

We integrate our\nconstructs into the recent DSPy programming\nmodel for LMs and present new strategies that\nallow DSPy to compile programs with LM As-\nsertions into more reliable and accurate systems.\nWe also propose strategies to use assertions at in-\nference time for automatic self-reﬁnement with\nLMs. We report on four diverse case studies for\ntext generation and ﬁnd that LM Assertions im-\nprove not only compliance with imposed rules\nbut also downstream task performance,, passing\nconstraints up to 164% more often and generat-\ning up to 37% more higher-quality responses.\n1. Introduction\nLanguage models (LMs) now power various applications,,\nfrom conversational agents to writing assistants. However ,,\nthe probabilistic nature of LMs often results in outputs\nthat may not align with the constraints of the domain or\nthe larger pipeline in which the LM is used. To address\nthis,, researchers have explored various techniques,, inclu d-\ning applying constrained decoding ( Hokamp & Liu ,,2017 ;\nHu et al. ,,2019 ),, exploring approaches for self-reﬂection\nand tree search ( Madaan et al. ,,2023 ;Shinn et al. ,,2023 ;\nYao et al. ,,2023 ),, building domain-speciﬁc languages and\nlike LMQL ( Beurer-Kellner et al. ,,2023 ),, or monitoring\nmodels with assertions and guardrails ( Kang et al. ,,2020 ;\nRebedea et al. ,,2023 ) to steer LMs towards more control-\nlable outputs.\nRecently,, several LM frameworks like LangChain ( Chase ,,\n2022 ) and DSPy ( Khattab et al. ,,2022 ;2024 ) provide devel-\nopers with interfaces to build complex LM pipelines. Some\noffer several features to control LM outputs,, e.g.,, DSPy canoptimize multi-stage prompts to maximize a target metric.\nHowever,, they cannot take arbitrary computational con-\nstraints on LM pipelines to either teach the LM to follow\nsuch constraints and/or to introspectively self-reﬁne out-\nputs. While some of this may be achieved via pain-staking\n“prompt engineering” or other ad-hoc guidance strategies,,\nsuch efforts are labor-intensive and conﬂate the high-leve l\ndesign of new AI systems with the low-level exploration of\nteaching LMs how to follow constraints.\nWe propose LM Assertions ,, a novel programming construct\ndesigned to enforce user-speciﬁed properties on LM out-\nputs within a pipeline. Drawing inspiration from runtime\nassertions and program speciﬁcations in traditional pro-\ngramming,, LM Assertions are expressed as boolean con-\nditions that express the desired characteristics of LM out-\nputs. We integrate LM Assertions into the recent DSPy pro-\ngramming model. Besides serving as conventional runtime\nmonitors,, LM Assertions enable multiple novel assertion-\ndriven optimizations to improve LM programs.\nAssertion-driven backtracking. LM Assertions can facil-\nitate runtime self-reﬁnement in LM pipelines at inference\ntime. When a constraint fails,, we allow the pipeline to back-\ntrack and retry the failing module. LM Assertions provide\nfeedback on retry attempts; they inject erring outputs and\nerror messages to the prompt to introspectively self-reﬁne\noutputs. Figure 1illustrates this within a DSPy pipeline.\nAssertion-driven example bootstrapping. LM Asser-\ntions can enable guided prompt optimizers at compile time.\nIntegrated with existing automatic prompt optimizers in\nDSPy,, they can enable generating harder few-shot exam-\nples,, which can teach LM programs to conduct challenging\nsteps.\nCounterexample bootstrapping. During prompt opti-\nmization and example bootstrapping,, another important\ncontribution of LM Assertions is to develop demonstrations\nthat contain failed examples and traces to ﬁx the errors.\nWhen the counterexamples are mixed with bootstrapped\nfew-shot examples,, the LM is more likely to avoid the same\nmistakes without assertion-driven backtracking.\n1\n\nDSPy Assertions: Computational Constraints for Self-Reﬁn ing Language Model Pipelines\nclassMultiHopQAWithAssertions( dspy.Module):\n...\ndefforward(self,, question):\ncontext,, queries = [],, [question]\nforhopin range (2):\nquery = self.generate _query(context=context,, question=question).query\ndspy.Suggest(len(query) < 100,,\n""Query should be less than 100 characters"" )\ndspy.Suggest(is_query_distinct(query,, queries),,\nf""Query should be distinct from { queries}"")\ncontext += self.retrieve(query).passages\nqueries.append(query)\nreturnself.generate _answer(context=context,, question=question)UPDATED PROMPT WITH FEEDBACK\nContext : . . .\nQuestion : . . .\nPast Query :<previousattempt w/errors>...\nInstruc tion:Query should bedistinct from...FAIL! ✗backtrack and regenerate query with new prompt\nFigure 1. DSPy program with LM Assertions for multi-hop question-ans wering task with a retriever. We introduce two soft assertio ns\n(suggestions): (1) query to retriever should be less than 10 0 characters; (2) query to retriever should differ from prev ious queries. For\ninstance,, if the second suggestion fails,, DSPy will constru ct a new prompt to retry the generate _query module with additional ﬁelds,,\nhighlighting the previously generated query and a user-deﬁ ned error message to help the LM reﬁne its generation.\nWe propose two types of LM Assertions: (hard) Assertions\nand (soft) Suggestions ,, denoted by Assert andSuggest ,,\nrespectively. Hard assertions represent critical conditi ons\nthat,, when violated after a maximum number of retries,,\ncause the LM pipeline to halt,, signaling a non-negotiable\nbreach of requirements. On the other hand,, suggestions de-\nnote desirable but non-essential properties; their violat ion\ntriggers the self-reﬁnement process,, but exceeding a maxi-\nmum number of retries does not halt the pipeline. Instead,,\nthe pipeline continues to execute the next module.\nWe implement our work atop DSPy,, a state-of-the-art\nframework for building and automatically optimizing\ndeclarative LM pipelines. The integration enables us to\ndesign and implement our three new assertion-driven op-\ntimizations . It enables DSPy programs to self-reﬁne and\nproduce outputs that adhere to speciﬁc guidelines. It simpl i-\nﬁes debugging,, providing developers a clearer understand-\ning of LM behavior in complex pipelines. In addition,, by\ncombining LM Assertions with prompt optimizers in DSPy,,\nwe can bootstrap better few-shot examples and counterex-\namples to assertions to make the pipeline more robust and\nperformant.\nWe evaluate the effectiveness of LM Assertions on four\nvaried knowledge-intensive tasks: multihop question an-\nswering (MultiHopQA),, long format question answering\n(LongFormQA),, formatted quiz generation (QuizGen),, and\nvalid tweet generation (TweetGen). Our experiments show\nthat LM Assertions and assertion-driven backtracking sig-\nniﬁcantly improve LM programs from generating 37.6%\nwell-formatted quizzes in JSON to 98.8% in QuizGen.Then,, with assertion-driven example bootstrapping and\ncounterexample bootstrapping,, we see an increase from\n2.0% to 73.0% in writing more engaging tweets in Tweet-\nGen and a consistent boost on almost all other assertion\nmetrics. Finally,, with LM Assertions and all assertion-\ndriven optimizations,, we see a maximum gain from 30.5%\nto 87.2% in generating valid quiz questions.\nOur contributions are,, ﬁrst,, introducing LM Assertions as\nan abstraction for language model programming. Then,,\nwe present three novel optimizations for LM pipelines:\nassertion-driven backtracking during inference to help\nmodels self-reﬁne,, assertion-driven example bootstrap-\nping to generate and choose more effective few-shot exam-\nples,, and counterexample bootstrapping to develop few-\nshot examples with erroneous results and corresponding\nﬁxes to help the model become more reliable at complying\nto developer-desired constraints.\n2. Background and Motivation\nThe goals of LM Assertions are general and can be applied\nto any LM program. Due to its modular paradigm,, ﬂexibil-\nity,, and extensibility,, we implement our work as extensions\nto the state-of-the-art DSPy ( Khattab et al. ,,2024 ) frame-\nwork. Below,, we brieﬂy describe the DSPy programming\nmodel for building declarative LM pipelines and compiling\nthem into auto-optimized prompt (or ﬁnetune) chains. We\nthen sketch a realistic,, motivating example for LM Asser-\ntions and show their usefulness for self-reﬁnement in LM\npipelines.\n2\n\nDSPy Assertions: Computational Constraints for Self-Reﬁn ing Language Model Pipelines\n2.1. The DSPy Programming model\nDSPy is a framework for programmatically solving ad-\nvanced tasks with language and retrieval models through\ncomposing and declaring modules. The overarching goal of\nDSPy is to replace brittle “prompt engineering” tricks with\ncomposable modules and automatic (typically discrete) op-\ntimizers.\nFirst,, instead of free-form string prompts,, a DSPy program-\nmer will deﬁne a signature to specify what an LM needs to\ndo declaratively. For instance,, a module may need to con-\nsume a question and return an answer,, as shown below:\nqa =dspy.Predict( ""question -> answer"" )\nqa(question= ""Where is the Eiffel tower?"" )\n# Output: The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris,, France.\nTo use a signature,, the programmer declares a module with\nthat signature,, like we deﬁned a Predict module above.\nThe core module for working with signatures in DSPy is\nPredict . Internally,, it stores the supplied signature. When\nthe signature is called,, like a function,, it constructs a for -\nmatted prompt according to the signature’s inputs and out-\nputs. Then,, it calls an LM with a list of demonstrations (if\nany) following this format for prompting.\nDSPy modules usually call dspy.Predict one or more\ntimes. They generally encapsulate prompting techniques,,\nturning them into modular functions that support any\nsignature. This contrasts with handwriting task-speciﬁc\nprompts with manually tuned instructions or few-shot ex-\namples. Consider,, for example,, the below DSPy module\nfrom Khattab et al. (2024 ),, which implements the popular\n“chain-of-thought” prompting technique ( Wei et al. ,,2022 ).\nclassChainOfThought( dspy.Module):\ndef__init__(self,, signature):\nrationale _field = dspy.OutputField(\nprefix=""Reasoning: Think step by step."" )\nsignature = dspy.Signature(signature).\nprepend_output_field(rationale _field)\nself.predict = dspy.Predict(signature)\ndefforward(self,, **kwargs):\nreturnself.predict( **kwargs)\nDSPy modules can be composed in arbitrary pipelines\nby ﬁrst declaring the modules needed at initialization\nand then expressing the pipeline with arbitrary code that\ncalls the modules in a forward method (as shown in the\nChainOfThought module above and the MultiHopQA program\nin Section 2.2). Finally,, DSPy provides optimizers that au-\ntomates generating good quality demonstrations (few-shot\nexamples) or instructions for a task given a metric to opti-\nmize. We may also refer to the few-shot example selection\nprocess as compiling the LM pipeline application.\nChallenges. DSPy signatures provide type hints that softlyshape LM’s behavior. However,, the framework currently\nlacks constructs developers can use to specify arbitrary\ncomputational constraints the pipeline must satisfy. Addi-\ntionally,, one can imagine the LM pipeline using these con-\nstraints to reﬁne its outputs and to teach the LM to respect\nthese speciﬁcations at compile time.\nTo address these challenges,, we integrate LM Assertions\nas ﬁrst-class primitives in DSPy. In the style of Pythonic\nassertions,, they are intuitive constructs that allow DSPy\nto constrain LM outputs. They are ﬂexible in that they\ncan be strict restrictions,, softer guidelines for backtrac king\nand self-correction of LM calls,, or simple debugging state-\nments. In what follows,, we describe a motivating example\nof a DSPy program that uses LM Assertions for multi-hop\nquestion answering.\n2.2. Motivating Example\nAiden is a developer building an LM pipeline for multi-hop\nquestion-answering. The task involves the LM performing\na series of inferential steps (multi-hop) before answering a\nquestion while utilizing a retriever to get relevant contex t.\nIn a simple DSPy implementation,, Aiden may design the\npipeline below,, where the LM generates search queries to\ncollect relevant context and aggregate them to generate the\nanswer.1\nclassMultiHopQA( dspy.Module):\ndef__init__(self):\nself.retrieve = dspy.Retrieve(k=3)\nself.gen _query = dspy.ChainOfThought( ""context,,question -> query"" )\nself.gen _answer = dspy.ChainOfThought( ""context,,question -> answer"" )\ndefforward(self,, question):\ncontext = []\nforhopin range (2):\nquery = self.gen _query(context=context,, question=question).query\ncontext += self.retrieve(query).passages\nreturnself.gen _answer(context=context,, question=question)\nHowever,, certain issues with the pipeline might affect its\nperformance. For instance,, since questions are complex,,\nthe generated search query could be long and imprecise,,\nresulting in irrelevant retrieved context. Another issue i s\nthat similar multi-hop queries would result in redundant re -\ntrieved context. One might observe that these are propertie s\nof generated queries that are computationally checkable\nand,, if expressible as constraints on the pipeline,, might im-\nprove its performance.\nFigure 1shows a DSPy program with LM Assertions for\nthis task. To mitigate the issues above,, Aiden introduces\ntwo soft LM Assertions: ﬁrst,, they restrict the length of\n1We borrow this implementation from Khattab et al. (2024 ).\nIt captures the key computations in popular multi-hop quest ion-\nanswering systems such as Baleen ( Khattab et al. ,,2021 ) and IR-\nCoT ( Trivedi et al. ,,2022 ).\n3\n\nDSPy Assertions: Computational Constraints for Self-Reﬁn ing Language Model Pipelines\nthe query to be less than 100 characters,, aiming for precise\ninformation retrieval. Second,, they require the query gen-\nerated at each hop to be dissimilar from previous hops,, dis-\ncouraging retrieval of redundant information. They specif y\nthese as soft constraints using the Suggest construct. The\nforce of this construct is to allow the pipeline to backtrack\nto the failing module and try again. On retrying,, the LM\nprompt also contains its past attempts and suggestion mes-\nsages,, enabling constraint-guided self-reﬁnement.\nIn Section 5,, we evaluate this pipeline on the Hot-\nPotQA ( Yang et al. ,,2018 ) dataset. We ﬁnd that enabling\nthe developer to express two simple suggestions improves\nthe retriever’s recall (by 6.5%–7.9%) and the accuracy of\ngenerated answers (by 3.4%–14.4%).\n3. Semantics of LM Assertions\nTo help with the goals mentioned above,, in this work,, we\nintroduce LM Assertions and integrate them in DSPy. We\ndeﬁne LM Assertions as programmatic elements that dic-\ntate certain conditions or rules that must be adhered to dur-\ning the execution of an LM pipeline. These constraints\nensure that the pipeline’s behavior aligns with developer-\nspeciﬁed invariants or guidelines,, enhancing the reliabil ity,,\npredictability,, and correctness of the pipeline’s output.\nWe categorize LM Assertions into two well-deﬁned pro-\ngramming constructs,, namely Assertions andSuggestions ,,\ndenoted by the constructs Assert andSuggest . They\nare constructs that enforce constraints and guide an LM\npipeline’s execution ﬂow.\nDelineating Assert from Conventional Assertions. The\nconventional assert statement,, built into most program-\nming languages,, is a debugging aid that checks a con-\ndition and,, if the condition evaluates to false,, raises an\nAssertionError exception,, typically terminating the pro-\ngram execution. In contrast,, our Assert construct offers\na sophisticated retry mechanism while supporting several\nnew optimizations. On an Assert failing,, the pipeline tran-\nsitions to a special retry state ,, allowing it to reattempt\na failing LM call while being aware of its previous at-\ntempts and the error message raised. If,, after a maxi-\nmum number of self-reﬁnement attempts,, the assertion still\nfails,, the pipeline transitions to an error state and raises\nanAssertionError ,, terminating the pipeline. This enables\nAssert to be much more powerful than conventional assert\nstatements,, leveraging the LM to conduct retries and adjust -\nments before concluding that an error is irrecoverable.\nDelineating Suggest fromAssert .In contrast to our Assert\nstatements,, our Suggest statements are softer constraints\nthat recommend but do not mandate conditions that may\nguide the LM pipeline toward desired domain-speciﬁc out-\ncomes. When a Suggest condition is not met,, like Assert,, the pipeline enters the special retry state,, allowing reat -\ntempts of the failing LM call and self-reﬁnement. How-\never,, if the suggestion fails after a maximum number of\nself-reﬁnement attempts,, the pipeline simply logs a warn-\ningSuggestionError message and continues execution. This\nallows the pipeline to adjust its behavior in response to the\nsuggestion while being ﬂexible and resilient to suboptimal\nstates (or sub-optimal or heuristic computational checks) .\nIn the following sections,, we deﬁne the default backtrack-\ning semantics of these constructs more formally. However,,\nwe provide the opportunity to extend custom semantics for\nbothAssert andSuggest (Appendix A.2).\n3.1. Semantics of Assert\nTheAssert construct enforces invariants within the LM\npipeline. The semantics of an assertion can be deﬁned in\nterms of a state transition system by adapting big-step oper -\national semantics notations in ( Kahn ,,1987 ) whereσrrepre-\nsents the pipeline’s state,, and the subscript rrepresents the\ncurrent retry count within the state σ. The maximum num-\nber of retries allowed per assertion is denoted by R. The\ntransition relation σr⊢i→σ′reads as “under the state σr,,\nthe instruction itransitions the state to σ′”. Now,, we deﬁne\na simpliﬁed semantics for Assert :\nσr⊢Assert(e,,m)→σ′\n0if eval(σ,,e) =true\nσr⊢Assert(e,,m)→σr+1 if eval(σ,,e) =false and r < R\nσr⊢Assert(e,,m)→σ⊥if eval(σ,,e) =false and r≥R\nHere,, eval (σ,,e)denotes the evaluation of expression ein\nstateσ. Ifeevaluates to true,, the pipeline transitions to\na new state σ′and continues execution. If eevaluates to\nfalse and the current retry count ris less than the maxi-\nmum allowed retries R,, the pipeline transitions to a retry\nstateσr+1. Here,, the pipeline attempts to recover or ad-\njust its behavior,, incrementing the retry count rby one. If\nthe assertion continues to fail and the retry count reaches\nR,, the pipeline transitions to an error state σ⊥,, and an\nAssertionError with message mis raised,, halting the exe-\ncution.\n3.2. Semantics of Suggest\nTheSuggest construct provides non-binding guidance to the\nLM pipeline. Similar to Assert ,, its semantics can be deﬁned\nas follows:\n4\n\nDSPy Assertions: Computational Constraints for Self-Reﬁn ing Language Model Pipelines\nσr⊢Suggest(e,,m)→σ′\n0if eval(σ,,e) =true\nσr⊢Suggest(e,,m)→σr+1 if eval(σ,,e) =false and r < R\nσr⊢Suggest(e,,m)→σ′′\n0if eval(σ,,e) =false and r≥R\nIf the expression eevaluates to true,, the pipeline transitions\nto a new state σ′and continues execution. If eevaluates\nto false and the current retry count rdoes not exceed the\nmaximum retries R,, the pipeline attempts to recover or ad-\njust its behavior in a retry state σr+1. However,, different\nfromAssert ,, if the suggestion continues to fail and the retry\ncountrreachesR,, the pipeline transitions to a new state\nσ′′where it resets the retry count,, logs the message mas\na warning of a SuggestionError that could not be resolved,,\nand continues executing the next pipeline module.\n4. Assertion-Driven Optimizations\n4.1. Assertion-Driven Backtracking\nBothAssert andSuggest allow the pipeline to retry a failing\nLM call and self-reﬁne its outputs in a special retry state.\nOne might observe that this involves dynamically altering\nthe control ﬂow of the LM pipeline during execution. On\npassing assertions and suggestions,, the control ﬂows typi-\ncally into the next LM pipeline module.\nTo handle assertion failures,, the LM pipeline may utilize\nan error handler that determines the next instruction to exe -\ncute. The handler takes the current erring state σand the er-\nror message mas inputs and returns a new state. In the new\nstate,, control ﬂows as described in Section 3.1and3.2. For\nbothAssert andSuggest ,, if the maximum retry attempts are\nnot surpassed,, the handler yields the control to the failing\nLM module with an updated prompt that includes past fail-\ning outputs and instructions. However,, upon exceeding the\nmaximum retries,, the handler halts the execution for a fail-\ningAssert or progresses to the next module in the pipeline\nfor aSuggest .\nIn Appendix A,, we describe the implementation of these\nconstructs and handlers in DSPy. Our implementation is\npublicly available and has been integrated into the DSPy\nframework.\n4.2. Assertion-Driven Example Bootstrapping\nLM Assertions can be useful in optimizing the prompts as\nwell. One optimizer BootstrapFewShot in DSPy employs a\nteacher-student method to use the teacher model to boot-\nstrap representative few-shot demonstrations for the stu-\ndent model for the same program. During the bootstrap-\nping step,, the teacher model can utilize LM Assertions asextra ﬁlters to bootstrap more robust examples.\nBased on our observation,, in some cases,, the naïve opti-\nmizer in DSPy would bootstrap an example with the correct\nﬁnal response while the intermediate module outputs are in-\ncorrect,, which leads to wrong demos for intermediate LM\nmodules. To enable assertion-driven example bootstrap-\nping,, we apply assertion-driven backtracking to the teache r\nmodel in the BootstrapFewShot optimizer. In this way,, all\nthe bootstrapped demonstrations are guaranteed to follow\nthe intermediate constraints,, too. In this way,, although th e\nprompt optimizer only has the metric for the ﬁnal answer,,\nthe examples selected will have higher qualities for all in-\ntermediate modules thanks to LM Assertions.\n4.3. Counterexample Bootstrapping\nWhen integrating LM Assertions and assertion-driven back-\ntracking in the teacher model of a prompt optimizer,, we can\ncollect traces where the language model fails certain asser -\ntions.\nThe optimizer in DSPy is able to incorporate feedback from\nthe erroneous examples during backtracking as demonstra-\ntions. The usage of counterexample is twofold. First,, coun-\nterexamples serve as negative demonstrations in the few-\nshot learning prompt,, guiding models to avoid making sim-\nilar mistakes. Second,, with assertion-driven backtrackin g,,\ncounterexample traces often come with the demonstrations\nof ﬁxing particular LM Assertion failures. These demon-\nstrations are helpful for the student model to achieve a\nmuch higher rate of passing the underlying constraints even\nwithout LM Assertions and assertion-drive backtracking.\nOverall,, with counterexample bootstrapping only,, the over -\nhead of backtracking and self-reﬁnement for the student\nmodel is completely eliminated while the program still\nhas the ability to generate more responses that adhere to\nprogrammer-deﬁned assertions.\n5. Evaluation\n5.1. Tasks & Metrics\nWe study various aspects of LM Assertions on 4interesting\nvariants of the popular HotPotQA ( Yang et al. ,,2018 ) task:\nT1MultiHopQA : A complex question-answering task in-\nvolving generating multi-hop search queries for ques-\ntions and using the retrieved context to generate the\ncorrect answer.\nT2LongFormQA : A more demanding question-\nanswering task,, where the generated answer must\ncontain citations that are faithful to the retrieved\ncontext information.\nT3TweetGen : A variant of HotPotQA,, where the gener-\n5\n\nDSPy Assertions: Computational Constraints for Self-Reﬁn ing Language Model Pipelines\nated answer is expected to be a concise and engaging\n“tweet” that is also faithful to the retrieved context.\nT4QuizGen : A task involving generating candidate an-\nswer choices for HotPotQA questions in a JSON format,,\nwith distractor choices and the correct answer.\nEach task is evaluated with two metric categories:\n•Intrinsic Quality measures the degree to which\nthe outputs conform to the LM Assertions speciﬁed\nwithin the program. This metric is a benchmark for\nthe system’s ability to pass internal validation checks.\n•Extrinsic Quality measures how LM Assertions af-\nfect downstream performance,, often on task-speciﬁc\nproperties we cannot assert directly without access to\nground-truth labels. Here,, assertions provide guidance\nthat indirectly inﬂuences overall performance.\nThese two metrics will respectively enable us to investi-\ngate the hypotheses that LM Assertions can facilitate self-\ncorrection and reﬁnement in LM pipelines ( H1) and that\nsuch guided self-reﬁnement can enhance the performance\nof downstream applications ( H2).\nWe provide a more comprehensive overview of the ad-\nvanced tasks LongFormQA (Appendix B.1),, QuizGen (Ap-\npendix B.2) and TweetGen (Appendix B.3),, evaluated met-\nrics,, and applied constraints in Appendix B.\n5.2. Dataset and Models\nWe utilize the HotPotQA ( Yang et al. ,,2018 ) dataset for\neach task in the open-domain “fullwiki” setting. We then\npartition the ofﬁcial training set into subsets: 70% for tra in-\ning and 30% for validation. We only focus on examples la-\nbeled as “hard” within the dataset to align with the criteria\nmarked by the ofﬁcial validation and test sets. For training\nand development sets,, we sample 300 examples each. We\nsample 500 examples for testing.\nWe use the ofﬁcial Wikipedia 2017 “abstracts” dump of\nHotPotQA using a ColBERTv2 ( Santhanam et al. ,,2021 )\nretriever for retrieval. We test the program using Ope-\nnAI’sgpt-3.5-turbo (Brown et al. ,,2020 ) withmax_tokens\n=500 andtemperature=0.7 for our experimental setup.\n5.3. Strategies\nTable 1summarizes the ﬁve strategies in which LM As-\nsertions (particularly Suggest ) can be utilized for each\ntask. First,, we distinguish uncompiled strategies (i.e.,, zero-\nshot) that predict responses directly from compiled strate-\ngies (i.e.,, few-shot) that contain demonstrations crafted\nby the DSPy compiler ( Khattab et al. ,,2024 ) using itsAssertion\nStrategy Compilation Student Teacher\nVanilla ✗ ✗ —\nCompile ✓ ✗ ✗\nInfer w/Assert ✗ ✓ —\nCompile w /Assert ✓ ✗ ✓\nC+Infer w/Assert ✓ ✓ ✓\nTable 1. Summary of assertion enabled strategies in DSPy.\nVanilla is the baseline with inference only,, and Compile is\nthe baseline with DSPy native compilation. Inferw/Assert\nsupports assertion-driven backtracking for inference onl y,,\nCompile w /Assert incorporates assertion-driven example boot-\nstrapping and counterexample bootstrapping during compil ation.\nFinally,,C+Infer w/Assert contains all the assertion-driven op-\ntimizations during compilation and inference.\nBootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch optimizer. In the com-\npiled setting,, we differentiate student and teacher module s,,\nwith the teacher compiling demonstrations for the student.\nNote that both teacher and student modules use the same\nLM in our experiments,, which is the default approach in\nDSPy,, but the teacher modules are executed on training ex-\namples and ﬁltered based on the metric.\nBaselines include the Vanilla strategy that performs zero-\nshot prediction with no LM Assertions applied and the\nCompile strategy that compiles few-shot learning with the\nnaive DSPy optimizer. Our strategies explore when asser-\ntions are applied: during inference (student only Infer\nw/Assert ),, during compilation (teacher only Compilew /\nAssert ),, or both ( C+Inferw/Assert ).\nTo ensure the baseline strategies are aware of the poten-\ntial constraints,, we add complex instructions (prompts)\ncontaining all the LM Assertion metrics in QuizGen and\nTweetGen to all pipelines. In this way,, strategies with as-\nsertions do not have the privilege of knowing the intrinsic\nmetrics. We also report experiments with minimal/generic\ninstructions in Appendix C,, where the baselines perform\nmuch worse and give our assertion strategies more perfor-\nmance advantages.\n5.4. Results\nOur evaluation aims to answer the following hypotheses:\nH1LM Assertions facilitate automated self-correction\nand reﬁnement through assertion-driven backtracking\nfor arbitrary LM pipelines by showing the LM past\noutputs and error messages.\nH2Assertion-driven backtracking with LM Assertions\ncan also enable LM pipelines to improve downstream\napplication performance.\nH3When used with compilation and prompt optimization,,\n6\n\nDSPy Assertions: Computational Constraints for Self-Reﬁn ing Language Model Pipelines\nMultiHopQA (Dev / Test)\nStrategy Suggestions Passed Retrieval Recall Answer Correctness\nVanilla 66.3 / 66.2 35.0 / 36.6 45.7 / 41.6\nInfer w/Assert 89.7 / 88.0 39.3 / 39.0 47.3 / 43.0\nCompile 71.3 / 63.4 37.0 / 40.2 43.7 / 40.4\nCompile w /Assert 78.3 / 71.6 44.3 / 42.2 52.7 / 46.2\nC+Infer w/Assert 95.7 /91.6 46.0 /43.4 53.3 / 45.4\nLongFormQA (Dev / Test)\nStrategy Citation Faithfulness Citation Recall Citation P recision Has Answer\nVanilla 77.3 / 78.8 51.5 / 52.1 58.1 / 59.2 65.7 / 60.2\nInfer w/Assert 90.0 / 90.8 56.3 /57.8 63.9 / 64.6 65.7 / 60.4\nCompile 82.3 / 79.6 41.0 / 39.8 76.8 / 73.5 68.3 / 56.4\nCompile w /Assert 84.0 / 81.2 55.8 / 53.5 66.4 / 63.5 68.0 / 57.4\nC+Infer w/Assert 92.7 /91.8 43.8 / 43.0 80.1 /76.3 69.7 / 55.4\nQuizGen (Dev / Test)\nStrategy Correct JSON Has Answer Citation Precision Validity\nVanilla 41.7 / 37.6 40.3 / 34.8 63.7 / 60.4 36.9 / 30.5\nInfer w/Assert 100/ 98.8 86.3 / 76.6 73.0 / 67.0 80.2 / 70.5\nCompile 100/100 96.3 / 92.8 68.3 / 63.8 86.1 / 81.7\nCompile w /Assert 100/ 99.8 95.0 / 91.6 70.0 / 62.4 85.1 / 80.5\nC+Infer w/Assert 100/100 96.3 /94.6 82.7 /75.4 91.0 /87.2\nTweetGen (Dev / Test)\nStrategy No ""#"" Has Answer Concise Engaging Faithful Quality\nVanilla 21.3 / 19.8 52.3 / 46.0 99.7 / 99.6 29.3 / 32.2 78.3 /79.0 34.7 / 30.5\nInfer w/Assert 71.7 / 67.6 48.7 / 41.0 98.3 / 96.6 37.0 / 36.4 67.7 / 70.4 38.3 / 30.6\nCompile 100/100 51.0 / 44.2 100/100 1.0 / 2.0 63.0 / 65.6 37.8 / 32.8\nCompile w /Assert 96.3 / 95.0 55.0 / 48.8 97.7 / 98.6 74.0 / 73.0 75.0 / 74.8 48.5 / 42.9\nC+Infer w/Assert 98.0 / 96.2 56.0 /49.2 96.7 / 97.2 90.7 /85.0 68.3 / 68.0 51.4 /45.0\nFigure 2. Evaluation of each task on the validation set (Dev) and the te st set (Test). Tasks are described in Section 5.1,, and LM pipeline\nconﬁguration are described in Table 1. For each task,, we use the same LM pipeline program except for the LM Assertions. Extrinsic\nmetrics (downstream application performance) are highlig hted in grey. For each metric,, higher is always better. The highest v alue in\neach column is in bold .\nLM Assertions bootstrap more robust and effective\nexamples/counterexamples,, aiding the goal of com-\nplying more with the computational constraints and\nachieving higher downstream performance.\n5.4.1. H1: S ELF-CORRECTION VIA LM A SSERTIONS\nTo study this hypothesis,, we mainly look at the intrinsic\nmetrics of the tasks,, i.e.,, metrics that check if the LM\npipeline conforms to the constraints of the LM assertions\nintroduced. In Figure 2,, we observe that LM Assertions\nconsistently provide gains for all tasks when comparing\ntheVanilla andInfer w/Assert strategies. That is,, in\na zero-shot setting,, introducing our self-reﬁnement-base d\nLM assertions substantially improves the pipeline’s abili ty\nto conform to specs,, e.g. in the MultiHopQA task (Fig-\nure1),, the number of Suggestions Passed increases by\n32.9% for the test set.\nThe increase is more prominent in the QuizGen task,, where\nthe LM program is tasked to generate a multiple-choice\nquiz question in JSON format. Without LM Assertions,, themodel pipeline struggles to generate quizzes in valid JSON\n(Correct JSON). However,, after including constraints that\nthe response should be in JSON and include the correct an-\nswer as one of the choices,, together with backtracking and\nself-reﬁnement to ﬁx these constraints,, the ﬁnal answers\nhave correct formatting 98.8% of the time and have the\nright answer 76.6% of the time.\n5.4.2. H2: P ERFORMANCE VIA SELF-CORRECTION\nNext,, we focus on whether deﬁning suggestions in the\nprogram can help achieve better downstream performance\nby comparing Infer w/Assert withVanilla . We ob-\nserve that on most tasks–MultiHopQA,, LongFormQA,, and\nQuizGen–we get a moderate to large improvement on ex-\ntrinsic/downstream metrics ( grey columns) when sugges-\ntions are deﬁned. Notably,, in QuizGen,, the overall Validity\nof the quiz generated increases from 30.5% to 70.5%.\nHowever,, on tasks like TweetGen,, we do not see a signiﬁ-\ncant increase in the overall Quality of the generated tweet\non the test set. We believe this is a case of “conﬂicting\n7\n\nDSPy Assertions: Computational Constraints for Self-Reﬁn ing Language Model Pipelines\nsuggestions”,, where sequentially deﬁned suggestions can\noverride each other’s impact if they are hard to disentangle\nduring self-reﬁnement. We observe similar behavior in a\nfew experiments in the compiled strategies of Compilew /\nAssert andC+Inferw/Assert and display a few exam-\nples in Appendix D.\n5.4.3. H3: C OMPILING WITH LM A SSERTIONS\nThen,, we explore an exciting use case of LM Assertions\nto serve as the ﬁlter and optimizer for few-shot demonstra-\ntions in prompt optimization. We evaluate all four tasks\non three settings: the baseline Compile ,, where the pro-\ngram utilizes a DSPy optimizer to bootstrap few-shot exam-\nples;Compile w /Assert ,, where we enable suggestions\nin the bootstrapping process only; and ﬁnally,, C+Infer\nw/Assert ,, where suggestions and self-reﬁnements are en-\nabled in both bootstrapping and compiled program during\ninference.\nBy comparing Compile withCompilew /Assert ,, we ﬁnd\nthat constructing few-shot examples that adhere to LM As-\nsertions and show the self-reﬁnement traces in the demon-\nstrations makes the LM pipeline more likely to adhere to\nthe same guidelines,, even without self-correction and back -\ntracking. For example,, in the TweetGen experiment,, the\nstrategy compiled with suggestions has a 73.0% chance of\ngenerating Engaging tweets,, while the baseline few-shot\nstrategy only generates 2.0%. Overall,, compiling with sug-\ngestions helps tweet generation gain 30.7% more overall\nQuality . For other tasks,, too,, compiling with assertions al-\nmost always shows stronger performance in intrinsic and\nextrinsic metrics.\nA surprising ﬁnding for TweetGen is the decrease in en-\ngagement ( Engaging ) when compiling with assertions. We\ninspect the responses of Compilew /Assert and ﬁnd that\nthe tweets are short,, thus less engaging. We suspect the\nfollowing reasons: ﬁrst,, the user-provided instruction to ﬁx\nthis suggestion may not be precise enough for an LLM to\nfollow. Second,, as we mentioned in the analysis for H2,,\nsome LM Assertions might conﬂict with each other,, mak-\ning discrete optimization of prompts challenging to satisf y\nall constraints.\nFinally,, we put everything together and build C+Infer w/\nAssert where suggestions are enabled at all times . This\nsetting performs best for most intrinsic metrics over all\nother strategies due to the high-quality few-shot examples\ncollected and runtime self-reﬁnement. In the MultiHopQA\nquestion answering task,, the compiled module with sugges-\ntions increases by 9.1% compared to the zero-shot baseline.\nIn QuizGen,, the zero-shot baseline only generates 30.5%\nvalid quiz questions,, while the ﬁnal compiled program is\nvalid 87.2% of the time. Similarly,, in TweetGen,, we see a\n47.5% increase. In LongFormQA cited long passage ques-tion answering,, although all the suggestions are more likel y\nto pass,, the answer inclusion ( Has Answer ) metric slightly\ndropped; this suggests the opportunities to ﬁnd better LM\nAssertions for this program that can potentially inﬂuence\nthe downstream tasks.\n6. Related Work\nProgramming with constraints is standard in most program-\nming languages. Languages like Java ( Bartetzko et al. ,,\n2001 ) and Python ( Python Software Foundation ,,2023 )\nsupport assertions as ﬁrst-class statements to perform run -\ntime checks of certain properties. However,, most runtime\nchecks can only be used to warn the programmer or abort\nthe execution.\nKang et al. (2020 ) proposed a concept called model asser-\ntions,, which can be used to monitor the behavior of ML\nmodels and to improve the quality of a model in training\nthrough data collection and weak supervision. LM Asser-\ntions and the pipeline optimizations we perform with them\ndiffer from model assertions in multiple ways: ﬁrst,, LM\nAssertions can be used for backtracking an LM pipeline to\nretry a failing module for self-reﬁnement,, which drastical ly\nimproves the performance of the pipeline; second,, LM As-\nsertions can be used as ﬁlters to select better examples for\nfew-shot learning; ﬁnally,, LM Assertions aid generating\ncounterexamples and ﬁxing traces,, which further enhance\nthe LM pipeline to learn from past failures and improve.\nMore recent efforts on generating controllable outputs\nfor language models include LMQL ( Beurer-Kellner et al. ,,\n2023 ),, NeMo Guardrails ( Rebedea et al. ,,2023 ),, etc. Al-\nthough these systems permit some sort of computation con-\nstraints,, they work on a single LM without consideration in\nthe LM pipeline setting,, which misses the assertion-driven\noptimization opportunities proposed by our work.\nBy integrating Python-style assertions,, we ensure pro-\ngrammers can clearly express computational constraints\non DSPy programs and assert desired program behav-\nior. These declarative constraints are leveraged in exten-\nsible and powerful ways to abstract and generalize no-\ntions of self-reﬁnement and DSPy’s capabilities for prompt\noptimization through compilation. We report on ini-\ntial evaluation of an implementation that does so in this\nwork. Such self-reﬁnement of LLMs ( Madaan et al. ,,2023 ;\nShridhar et al. ,,2023 ) is central to this approach in making\nDSPy autonomous and context-aware ( Tyen et al. ,,2023 ).\nEnforcing methodologies of iterative reﬁnement using erro r\nfeedback ( Xu et al. ,,2023 ) and utilizing reasoning capabil-\nities through presenting past generations and feedback for\ncorrection ( Qiu et al. ,,2023 ) resonates with the objective of\nDSPy assertions.\n8\n\nDSPy Assertions: Computational Constraints for Self-Reﬁn ing Language Model Pipelines\n7. Conclusion\nWe have introduced LM Assertions,, a new construct\nfor expressing arbitrary computational constraints on the\nbehavior of LMs when used as building blocks of\nlarger programs. We integrate LM Assertions into the\nDSPy ( Khattab et al. ,,2024 ) programming model,, deﬁne\nruntime retry semantics,, and an implementation for them\nthat abstracts and generalizes LM self-reﬁnement ap-\nproaches to arbitrary steps in arbitrary pipelines. We also\ndiscuss several other mechanisms that our LM Assertion\nconstructs can use to inform DSPy compilation into higher-\nquality prompts that reduce the assertion failure rates. Ou r\nevaluations show substantial gains on four case studies,, re -\nporting both intrinsic (i.e.,, assertion-speciﬁc) and extr insic\n(i.e.,, downstream) task metrics. By enabling DSPy pro-\ngrams to autonomously backtrack and self-correct and com-\npile better few-shot examples,, we hope to open avenues for\nbuilding more reliable LM programs at higher levels of ab-\nstraction than was previously possible.\nImpact Statement\nThis paper presents work whose goal is to advance the ﬁeld\nof Machine Learning. There are many potential societal\nconsequences of our work,, none which we feel must be\nspeciﬁcally highlighted here.\nReferences\nBartetzko,, D.,, Fischer,, C.,, Möller,, M.,, and Wehrheim,,\nH.

Implementation\nWe introduce the proposed LM Assertions as plug-in interfac es in the DSPy framework according to the semantics in\nSection 3. Next,, we describe details about the design of our APIs and ho w we implement the semantics of both Assert and\nSuggest in DSPy.\nA.1. API Design\ndspy.Assert(constraint: bool,, msg: Optional[ str],,\nbacktrack: Optional[module])\ndspy.Suggest(constraint: bool,, msg: Optional[ str],,\nbacktrack: Optional[module])\nWe inherit a simple API design for LM Assertions. Both sugges tions and assertions take a boolean value constraint as\ninput. Note that the computation for constraint can invoke other DSPy modules,, potentially calling the LM to inform the\nresult for the constraint. Then,, the user provides an option al error message,, which is used for error logging and feedbac k\nconstruction for backtracking and reﬁnement. Finally,, to e nable backtracking,, both dspy.Assert anddspy.Suggest contains\nan optional backtrack argument,, which points to the target module to backtrack to i f the constraints fail.\nA.2. Error Handlers\nTo implement various strategies of both assertions and sugg estions for different use cases,, we exploit Python’s native error\nand exception handling.\nWe encode error-handling logic as function wrappers. To tha t extent,, we provide a primitive constraint _tranform to\nwrap any DSPy module with handlers. When the constraints in dspy.Assert anddspy.Suggest are false,, they raise\nAssertionError andSuggestionError ,, respectively. Then,, the dedicated error handling clause i n the function wrapper can\nreroute the errors to the correct semantics.\nAs a result,, the program’s behavior after an assertion or sug gestion error is completely controlled by the handlers used .\nTo support ﬂexibility in using LM Assertions with DSPy,, we im plement several composable handlers,, such as disabling\nsuggestions and assertions,, suppressing assertion errors with logging,, etc.\nThe default handlers follow the semantics as described in Se ction 3to enable self-reﬁnement. That is,, we allow R\nretry attempts for AssertionError andSuggestionError by backtracking to the failing LM. After Rretry attempts,, an\nAssertionError will be raised while SuggestionError will only be logged silently.\nA.3. Backtracking\nTo implement backtracking in DSPy,, we introduce a new auxili arymeta- module called Retry . This module is a lightweight\nwrapper for any DSPy module,, providing additional informat ion about all previously unsuccessful predictions. When DS Py\ndetermines the need to backtrack to a speciﬁc module,, it call sRetry . As shown in Figure 1,, theRetry module automatically\nadds the failed predictions and the corresponding user-deﬁ ned error messages raised to the prompt. Then,, the LM pipelin e\ncan backtrack to the previously failed module with this upda ted prompt. In this way,, the original module to reﬁne is self-\naware and informed of past attempts and errors on them. Conse quently,, this empowers the LM to develop more informed\nand error-avoiding generations in subsequent iterations o f self-reﬁnement.\nB. Case Studies\nB.1. LongFormQA\nB.1.1. T ASK\nIn this task,, we build on the Multi-Hop QA (Figure 1) task by expecting long-form answers to questions that incl ude\ncitations to referenced context.\nFigure 3shows an implementation of this task in DSPy. As shown,, it is n early identical to Figure 1outside of the introduc-\ntion of a new dspy.ChainOfThought module that generates cited paragraphs referencing the ret rieved context. With this task\n11\n\nDSPy Assertions: Computational Constraints for Self-Reﬁn ing Language Model Pipelines\nclassLongFormQAWithAssertions( dspy.Module):\ndef__init__(self,, passages _per_hop=3):\nself.retrieve = dspy.Retrieve(k=passages _per_hop)\nself.generate _query = dspy.ChainOfThought( ""context,, question -> query"" )\nself.generate _cited_paragraph = dspy.ChainOfThought( ""context,, question -> paragraph"" )#has field description to\ninclude citations\ndefforward(self,, question):\ncontext = []\nforhopin range (2):\nquery = self.generate _query(context=context,, question=question).query\ncontext += self.retrieve(query).passages\npred = self.generate _cited_paragraph(context=context,, question=question)\ndspy.Suggest(citations _check(pred.paragraph),, ""Every 1-2 sentences should have citations: ’text...

We introdu ce\ntwo suggestions: (1) asserting every 1-2 sentences has a cit ation; (2) every text segment preceding a citation is faithf ul to its cited\nreference.\nand LM pipeline,, we aim not just to produce accurate answers b ut to generate well-structured long-form answers that are\nfaithful to the retrieved context.\nB.1.2. M ETRICS\nWe assess intrinsic performance using a sophisticated metr ic,, Citation Faithfulness. In this metric,, a small DSPy prog ram\nuses the LM to check if the text preceding each citation appro priately supports the cited context. Our check outputs a\nboolean for faithfulness,, which is then averaged across the citations in the output to aggregate a metric for evaluation . As\nextrinsic metrics,, we use: (1) Answer Correctness,, verifyi ng if thegold answer is correctly incorporated; (2) Citation\nPrecision,, gauging the proportion of correctly cited title s; and (3) Citation Recall,, measuring the coverage of gold titles\ncited.\nB.1.3. C ONSTRAINTS SPECIFIED\nAs a simple initial check,, we include a Suggest statement that requires every 1–2 of sentences generated ha s citations in\nan intended format. This is checked by a simple Python functi oncitations _check . As a more sophisticated check,, we\nSuggest that the text preceding any citation must be faithful to the c ited context,, ensuring that the reference text accurately\nrepresents the content of the cited information. Since this is a fuzzy condition,, we employ a small DSPy program (one\nthat uses the LM) to perform this check. Notably,, the robust A PI design of Suggest allows the user to specify arbitrary\nexpressions as conditional checks,, such as an LM call.

We\nimplement this program using the DSPy pro-\ngramming model,, which specifies in-context\nsystems in a declarative manner,, and use DSPy\noptimizers to tune it towards specific datasets\nby bootstrapping only tens of few-shot exam-\nples. Our primary extreme classification pro-\ngram,, optimized separately for each task,, at-\ntains state-of-the-art results across three bench-\nmarks (HOUSE,, TECH,, TECHWOLF). We\napply the same program to a benchmark with\nvastly different characteristics and attain com-\npetitive performance as well (BioDEX). Unlike\nprior work,, our proposed solution requires no\nfinetuning,, is easily applicable to new tasks,, al-\nleviates prompt engineering,, and requires only\ntens of labeled examples. Our code is public at\nhttps://github.com/KarelDO/xmc.dspy .\n1 Introduction\nExtreme multi-label classification (XMC) tasks are\nhard to solve with in-context learning alone. Lan-\nguage models (LMs) might lack prior knowledge\nabout the precise classes,, and the sheer number\nof available classes—often upwards of 10,,000—\ngenerally means it is infeasible even to demon-\nstrate every class in a prompt. To deal with this,,\nsome recent efforts make multiple LM calls at in-\nference time (Zhu and Zamani,, 2023),, while others\nprompt LMs to generate synthetic data for finetun-\ning (Decorte et al.,, 2023; Clavié and Soulié,, 2023).\nThese methods can be configured to work well,,\nbut they all have manual “knobs” like prompts andother hyperparameters that make applying them to\nnew datasets,, metrics,, or LMs challenging.\nIn this paper,, we show that simple programs\nwritten using the DSPy programming model (Khat-\ntab et al.,, 2023) support powerful,, highly gen-\neral approaches to XMC tasks. DSPy allows\nus to separately specify the modular program\nof our method and how it should be optimized\ntowards different datasets. We propose a sim-\nple in-context program for XMC tasks called\nInfer–Retrieve–Rank (IReRa ,, Figure 1,, Step 1).\nFirst,, an LM processes the input document and\nguesses a set of applicable terms ( Infer ). Then,, a\nretriever relates each predicted term to the actual\nlabel space ( Retrieve ). Finally,, an LM is used to\nrerank retrieved labels ( Rank ). Crucially,, we use a\nfrozen retriever and frozen LMs. The key insights\nofInfer–Retrieve–Rank is that such a frozen re-\ntriever can be made much more flexible if the LM\nlearns in-context how to predict relevant queries\nand interpret the retrieved results.\nThe underlying LMs,, retriever,, and prompts are\nconsidered hyperparameters of theIReRa program,,\nwhich can be tuned automatically or easily con-\nfigured. Using only 10 unlabeled training inputs,,\nand≈50 labeled validation examples,, we bootstrap\na few-shot prompt for our two LM components,,\nusing a zero-shot teacher LM with a minimal seed-\nprompt (Figure 1,, Step 2). DSPy ’s compilation ab-\nstraction handles this nicely; it takes the program\nlogic we’ve already defined,, instantiates it with a\nteacher LM,, processes the unlabeled training ex-\namples,, generates zero-shot labels for each of the\nprogram steps,, and picks the best labels to put in a\nfew-shot prompt based on validation performance.\nBecause our program consists of two in-context\nmodules,, we propose to bootstrap them sequen-\ntially (Figure 1,, Step 3).\nIn our experiments,, we instantiate the Infer\nmodule with a Llama-2-7b-chat model (Touvron\net al.,, 2023),, while the teacher model used for boot-arXiv:2401.12178v1  [cs.CL]  22 Jan 2024\n\nFigure 1: We propose Infer-Retrieve-Rank ,, an efficient in-context learning program for multi-label classification\nwith an extreme amount of classes ( ≥10,,000). Given an input,, a first in-context learning module predicts queries\nwhich route to a frozen retriever. The retrieved documents are re-ranked by a second in-context module ( Step 1 ).\nGiven a minimal prompt ( Step 2 ),, a zero-shot Teacher LM bootstraps demonstrations to optimize the few-shot\nStudent LM (Step 3 ). Optimization using ≈50 labeled inputs can yield state-of-the-art results,, using only ≈20\nTeacher and ≈1,,500 Student calls. The (optimization) logic is expressed using the DSPy programming model.\nstrapping is GPT-3.5 . TheRank module is instanti-\nated and bootstrapped both by a GPT-4 model.\nAdapting Infer–Retrieve–Rank to a new\ndataset can be as simple as (i) writing a new mini-\nmal zero-shot prompt,, (ii) configuring which LMs\nto use,, and (iii) running the optimization proce-\ndure. We optimize this program separately towards\n4 XMC datasets: one dataset involving the extract-\ning and coding of adverse drug events expressed in\nbiomedical literature (BioDEX; D’Oosterlinck et al.\n2023) and three datasets involving the labeling of\njob vacancy snippets with the required competen-\ncies they express (HOUSE,, TECH,, TECHWOLF;\nZhang et al. 2022; Decorte et al. 2022,, 2023). Our\nprogram attains state-of-the-art results on the job\nvacancy datasets,, and gets meaningful traction on\nthe harder biomedical task—without finetuning,,\nwithout prompt engineering,, and by using only ≈50\nlabeled examples. We find that the optimization is\na consistent driver of performance across tasks.\n2 Related Work\nThe canonical way of tackling an extreme classi-\nfication problem involves either finetuning a spe-\ncialized retriever over the label space or finetuningone binary classifier per class (Decorte et al.,, 2022,,\n2023; Clavié and Soulié,, 2023). These methods\nrequire a lot of data,, since every one of the many\nclasses requires at least a few labeled examples.\nTo avoid manual data labeling,, researchers use dis-\ntant supervision (Decorte et al.,, 2022),, bootstrap\nsynthetic data using LLMs (Decorte et al.,, 2023;\nClavié and Soulié,, 2023; De Raedt et al.,, 2023),, or\nfinetune retrievers on adjacent problems where data\nis available (Remy et al.,, 2022). At inference time,,\nan additional LLM call can be used to rerank a list\nof generated candidate labels to further increase\nperformance (Clavié and Soulié,, 2023).\nZhu and Zamani (2023) use multiple GPT-3.5\ncalls combined with retrieval at inference-time to\nbootstrap a synthetic prompt per input,, infer labels,,\nand rerank them. While they do not use any fine-\ntuning,, they require many LLM and retrieval calls\nper input. They evaluate on two recommendation\ntasks,, where inputs and outputs are the same type\nof documents. Bhatia et al. (2016) formulate many\nrecommendation tasks under the XMC setting. In-\nstead,, we consider XMC tasks where inputs and\noutputs are not of similar shape,, and more inference\nor information extraction is needed.\n\nOurInfer–Retrieve–Rank program does not\nrely on finetuning or many LLM calls per in-\nput,, making it efficient to develop and deploy.\nInfer–Retrieve–Rank can achieve state-of-the-\nart performance using only ≈50 labeled examples.\nUnlike prior work,, our program logic is defined\nin a modular and declarative manner,, and can be\nseamlessly applied to different benchmarks given a\nminimal seed-prompt. Optimization happens auto-\nmatically and can resolve in as little as ten minutes.\nThe choice of LMs and retrievers can be configured,,\nensuring relevance when stronger components be-\ncome available. Finally,, we write at most one seed-\nprompt per task and in-context module,, and let\noptimization—not iterative prompt engineering—\ntake care of increasing performance.\n3Infer–Retrieve–Rank\nThe program for Infer–Retrieve–Rank is given\nin Code Snippet 1,, with minor alterations for\nbrevity. First,, an LM is used to predict queries\ngiven the input ( Infer ). The retriever outputs a\nranking over all labels based on maximum cosine\nembedding similarity with the queries ( Retrieve ).\nThe top labels are reranked by another LM ( Rank ).\n1class InferRetrieveRank(dspy.Module):\n2def __init__(self,, infer_sig,, rank_sig,, retr):\n3# Initialize LM modules with Signatures\n4self.infer = dspy.ChainOfThought(infer_sig)\n5self.rank = dspy.ChainOfThrought(rank_sig)\n6self.retrieve = retr\n7\n8def forward(self,, text: str) -> Prediction:\n9# Predict with LM\n10preds = self.infer(text).completions.labels\n11\n12# Parse LM output\n13preds = extract_labels_from_strings(preds)\n14\n15# Use LM outputs to retrieve labels\n16labels = self.retrieve(preds)\n17\n18# Use LM to rerank labels\n19labels = self.rank(text,, labels)\n20\n21return dspy.Prediction(labels=labels)\nCode Snippet 1: DSPy code forInfer–Retrieve–Rank\nwith minor alterations for brevity.\nNot all labels occur with equal frequency. Fine-\ntuned methods can implicitly learn this bias given\nenough data.

The\nupdated scores ˜sias defined below are the output\nof theRetrieve module. Ais a scalar hyperparam-\neter controlling the strength of the prior update:\n˜si=si⋅log10(A⋅pi+10)4 Seed-prompts\nTo apply Infer–Retrieve–Rank to a dataset,, a\nminimal seed-prompt needs to define the behav-\nior of each in-context module. Code Snippet 2\ncontains the prompt for the Infer module on the\nBioDEX dataset,, neatly organized using the DSPy\nSignature abstraction. This seed-prompt defines\na task description in the docstring,, and input and\noutput fields with descriptions and formatting in-\nformation.

Given a gold num-\nber of labels Rnfor input n,, the RP@Kmeasures\nprecision @Kwhen K≤Rnandrecall @Kwhen\nK≥Rn.1Rel(n,, k)=1if the k-th output for\ninputnin the ranking was relevant,, else 0.\nRP@K=1\nNN\n∑\nn=11\nmin(K,, R n)K\n∑\nk=1Rel(n,, k)\n6 Data\nWe evaluate our method and baselines on four ex-\ntreme classification datasets,, one in the biomedical\nfield and three in the field of human-resources.\nBioDEX: The BioDEX dataset (Biomedical\nDrug Event eXtraction; D’Oosterlinck et al. 2023)\nconsists of biomedical papers containing various\ndescriptions of adverse drug events and associated\nexpert-created labels for the exact type of medi-\ncal reaction discussed. These events are encoded\nin the MedDRA ontology (Medical Dictionary for\nRegulatory Activities; Brown et al. 1999),, a set\nof≈24,,300 standardized medical reaction. Inputs\ncan be very long (half of inputs have upwards\nof≈20,,000 characters),, and biomedical domain\nknowledge is needed to infer the correct reactions\n(not all medical reactions need to be reported,, only\ntheadverse ones). BioDEX models a crucial step\nin real-world drug safety pipelines. We use a subset\nof 10 training,, 50 validation,, and 250 test examples\nfor our experiments. The median amount of labels\nper input is 3 while the 95th percentile is 14.\n1WhenK=Rn,, the precision and the recall of the ranking\nare by definition equal (Aslam et al.,, 2005).ESCO: The ESCO ontology (European Commis-\nsion Directorate-General for Employment,, Social\nAffairs and Inclusion,, 2017) contains ≈13,,900 dis-\ntinct concepts used to encode skills,, competences,,\nqualifications,, and occupations. We consider three\ndatasets each containing snippets (typically one\nsentence) of online job vacancies in English with\ntheir relevant ESCO labels. We use the HOUSE,,\nTECH,, and TECHWOLF datasets (Zhang et al.,,\n2022; Decorte et al.,, 2022,, 2023). We take 10\nexamples each from the HOUSE and TECH valida-\ntion sets as training examples,, and keep the remain-\ning 51 and 65 examples as validation respectively.\nTECHWOLF has no validation or training split,, so\nwe use the train and validation split of HOUSE\ninstead. HOUSE,, TECH,, and TECHWOLF respec-\ntively contain 262,, 338,, and 326 test examples.\nThe median amount of labels per input across these\ndatasets is 1 and the 95th percentile is 4.\n7 Experiments and Results\nTable 1 gives test results for all models and tasks.\nBaselines We evaluate a set of baselines across\nthe four tasks. First,, we evaluate a ranking\nequal to the prior statistic over all the labels\n(prior ). For BioDEX,, we estimate these pri-\nors across all the BioDEX training data. For\nthe ESCO datasets,, we use the priors distributed\nby Decorte et al. (2023),, which are calculated\nfrom a private training set. Subsequently we evalu-\nate the performance of exactly matching the label\nnames in the input document ( exact-match ). Fi-\nnally,, we embed the input document with an off-\nthe-shelf retriever and retrieve over label embed-\ndings. We use the pre-trained all-mpnet-base-v2\nmodel (Reimers and Gurevych,, 2019) for ESCO-\ntasks and BioLORD (Remy et al.,, 2022),, a biomedi-\ncal retriever,, for BioDEX ( naive-retrieve ).\nThrough these baselines,, an interesting dis-\ntinction between BioDEX and the ESCO-tasks\nemerges. Off-the-shelf retrieval is much stronger\non ESCO-tasks. We hypothesize this is due to\nthe shape of the input documents. Entire biomedi-\ncal publications are hard to compress into a single\nvector—especially with an off-the-shelf retriever.\nThe short vacancy snippets are easier to handle.\nInfer–Retrieve–Rank We instantiate the\nInfer module with a Llama-2-7b-chat stu-\ndent LM and GPT-3.5-turbo teacher LM.

Each run involves 10 unlabeled training\nexamples and ≈50 labeled validation exam-\nples. Every run incurs ≈20 teacher model\ncalls and≈1,,500 student model calls,, and can\ncomplete in tens of minutes. We use dspy ’s\nBootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch class to\nautomate the prompt bootstrapping procedure. A\ndetailed breakdown of optimization and inference\ncosts,, in function of the different LMs used,, is\ngiven in Section 8. We set the prior hyperparameter\nAto 0 for ESCO-tasks and 1000 for BioDEX,,\nbased on a handful of validation runs.\nFor ESCO-tasks,, we compare with the best\nfinetuned systems from the literature. retrieve\ndenotes the retriever of Decorte et al. (2023),,\nretrieve-rankGPT3.5/4 denotes the system with\ninference-time reranking of Clavié and Soulié\n(2023). For BioDEX,, we slightly alter the\nmethod of D’Oosterlinck et al. (2023): we take\naFLAN-T5-Large model (Chung et al.,, 2022) and\ntrain it to output a comma-separated list of reactionlabels given a chunk of the input paper (the origi-\nnal BioDEX system was trained to output many at-\ntributes,, of which medical reactions was only one).\nThis model does not directly produce a ranking,, so\nif a reaction is not predicted we add it in order of\nthe prior ( seq2seq-prior ). We also consider sam-\npling 10 generations from the model and majority\nvoting the reactions ( 10×seq2seq-prior ).\nInfer–Retrieve–Rank achieves state-of-the-\nart performance across all ESCO-tasks. Through\na set of ablations,, we find that each optimization\nstep and module improves performance. Notable,,\ntheInfer-Retrieve system,, which ablates the\nRank module,, can still attain competitive results\ndespite using only one open-source LM and frozen\nretriever. Infer–Retrieve–Rank does not beat our\nfinetuned system on BioDEX,, but adding a Rank\nmodule or optimizing Infer consistently improves\nperformance,, indicating that programs can support\na general approaches to extreme multi-label classi-\nfication across a variety of datasets with different\ncharacteristics.\n\nConfiguration Optimize Calls Calls / Input\nLM Teacher LM Teacher LM\nModules\nInfer Llama GPT3.5 ≈500≈10 1\nRetrieve mpnet (or similar) None 0 0 1\nRank GPT4 GPT4 ≈500≈10 1\nPrograms\nInfer–Retrieve–Rank Llama -mpnet -GPT4 GPT3.5 -None -GPT4≈1,,500≈20 3\n−optimizeRank Llama -mpnet -GPT4 GPT3.5 -None ≈1,,000≈10 3\nInfer-Retrieve Llama -mpnet GPT3.5 -None ≈1,,000≈10 2\n−optimizeInfer Llama -mpnet None -None 0 0 2\nTable 2: Breakdown of configuration and costs associated with our Modules andPrograms . A module is configured\nwith a single LM and Teacher. A program inherits all LMs of its modules,, and all Teachers of its optimized modules.\nPer module,, the optimization procedure requires O(train )Teacher calls and num_programs ⋅O(val)LM calls,,\nwhere num_programs is a hyperparameter controlling how many programs to try during optimization. During\ninference,, 1 LM call is used per module. Programs inherit the optimization calls of their optimized modules,, and the\ninference calls of all modules. While Retrieve is not directly optimized,, it does contribute inference calls to the\noptimization of Infer-Retrieve because the Retrieve module is in the optimization loop. In this work,, we use\n10 training examples,, ≈50 validation examples,, and set num_programs to 10.\n8 Program Cost Breakdown\nTable 2 outlines the optimization and inference\ncalls associated with our modules and programs.\nA module is always instantiated with one LM,,\nbut can also have another Teacher LM if it is\noptimizable. In our case,, the Infer andRank\nmodules have a Teacher while Retrieve does\nnot. Optimizing a module given its inputs in-\ncursO(train )calls from the Teacher model and\nnum_programs ⋅O(validation )calls from the Stu-\ndent LM,, where train andvalidation denote the\nsizes of the training and validation sets respectively,,\nandnum_programs controls how many different\nbootstrapped prompts to try in the optimization\nprocess. In our work,, this results in ≈10 Teacher\nand≈500 LM calls per module.\nPrograms inherit the configuration and calls from\ntheir constituent modules. Teacher optimization\ncalls are only inherited if the module is actually\noptimized,, LM optimization calls are inherited if\nthe module is in the loop for another optimized\nmodule,, and inference calls are always inherited.\nTable 2 makes it easy to express the cost as-\nsociated with any program. For example,, our\nstate-of-the-art Infer–Retrieve–Rank program\nrequires approximately 500 Llama ,, 500mpnet ,, 10\nGPT3.5 ,, and 510 GPT4 calls to optimize. This is\ncalculated as follows. First,, 500 Llama and 500mpnet student LM calls and 10 GPT3.5 teacher\ncalls are needed to optimize Infer-Retrieve .\nThen an additional 500 GPT4 student LM calls\nand 10GPT4 teacher calls are needed to optimize\nRank . Notice how Infer-Retrieve is in the loop\nwhileInfer–Retrieve–Rank is optimized. Be-\ncause of the left-to-right nature of this optimiza-\ntion procedure,, we can cache the inference calls of\nInfer-Retrieve ,, saving us the cost of executing\nthem again when optimizing Rank . Per new input,,\nthe program incurs 1 call for each Llama ,,mpnet ,,\nandGPT4 LM.\nThe finetuned systems we compare to in Table 1\nall have a much higher start-up cost,, in part due to\nthe need for labeled finetuning data—which some\nsystems need to bootstrap—and other costs asso-\nciated with finetuning such as increased hardware\nrequirements. These finetuned systems can be more\nefficient per test-time input,, given that we currently\nrely on 2 open-source local calls and 1 closed-\nsource API call for Infer–Retrieve–Rank . Our\nInfer-Retrieve program is considerably cheaper\nto deploy since it relies only on open-source com-\nponents,, while still being competitive. In the fu-\nture,, we plan to use an open-source LM for Rank ,,\nmaking our best program considerably cheaper to\ndeploy as well.\n\n9 Conclusion\nWe introduced Infer–Retrieve–Rank ,, a general\nprogram for extreme multi-label classification.\nInfer–Retrieve–Rank achieves state-of-the-art\nresults on three benchmarks using one frozen re-\ntriever combine with two in-context learning mod-\nules. These findings show that the future of prompt\nand pipeline engineering need not be brittle. Mod-\nular programs,, once optimized,, can serve as highly\neffective general-purpose solutions.\nLimitations\nThe best Infer–Retrieve–Rank program cur-\nrently requires one GPT-4 call per input document,,\nwhich may not feasible for all applications. In the\nfuture,, we plan to explore more efficient versions\nofInfer–Retrieve–Rank which rely fully on low-\ncost open-source components.\nWhile our optimization procedure allevi-\nates the need for iterative prompt engineering,,\nInfer–Retrieve–Rank does rely on an initial\nseed-prompt and performance may vary with spu-\nrious features of these prompts. In the future,,\nwe plan to quantify how different optimization\nprocedures can reduce prompt brittleness,, using\nInfer–Retrieve–Rank and our benchmark suite.\nEthics Statement\nWe have applied Infer–Retrieve–Rank to the im-\nportant real-world tasks of biomedical informa-\ntion extraction and job vacancy screening. LMs\nmake mistakes and are biased towards certain pre-\ndictions (Bender et al.,, 2021). We advise against\nthe deployment of Infer–Retrieve–Rank in these\ncrucial real-world tasks without proper understand-\ning of the risks involved and how to best measure\nand mitigate them.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to Jens-Joris Decorte and Johannes\nDeleu for their useful comments,, and to Jens-Joris\nDecorte for providing us with prior statistics on\nthe ESCO-tasks.

Exist-\ning work has combined these in simple “retrieve-\nthen-read” pipelines in which the RM retrieves\npassages that are inserted into the LM prompt.\nTo begin to fully realize the potential of frozen\nLMs and RMs,, we propose DEMONSTRATE –\nSEARCH –PREDICT (DSP ),, a framework that re-\nlies on passing natural language texts in sophisti-\ncated pipelines between an LM and an RM. DSP\ncan express high-level programs that bootstrap\npipeline-aware demonstrations,, search for rele-\nvant passages,, and generate grounded predictions,,\nsystematically breaking down problems into small\ntransformations that the LM and RM can handle\nmore reliably.

Introduction\nIn-context learning adapts a frozen language model (LM) to\ntasks by conditioning the LM on a textual prompt including\ntask instructions and a few demonstrating examples (Mc-\nCann et al.,, 2018; Radford et al.,, 2019; Brown et al.,, 2020).\nFor knowledge-intensive tasks such as question answering,,\nfact checking,, and information-seeking dialogue,, retrieval\nmodels (RM) are increasingly used to augment prompts\n1Stanford University .

A comparison between three systems based on GPT-\n3.5 (text-davinci-002 ). On its own,, the LM often makes false\nassertions. An increasingly popular retrieve-then-read pipeline\nfails when simple search can’t ﬁnd an answer. In contrast,, a task-\naware DSP program successfully decomposes the problem and\nproduces a correct response. Texts edited for presentation.\nwith relevant information from a large corpus (Lazaridou\net al.,, 2022; Press et al.,, 2022; Khot et al.,, 2022).\nRecent work has shown such retrieval-augmented in-context\nlearning to be effective in simple “retrieve-then-read”\npipelines: a query is fed to the RM and the retrieved pas-\nsages become part of a prompt that provides context for\nthe LM to use in its response. In this work,, we argue that\nthe fact that both LMs and RMs consume (and generate or\nretrieve) natural language texts creates an opportunity for\nmuch more sophisticated interactions between them. Fully\nrealizing this would be transformative: frozen LMs and\nRMs could serve as infrastructure across tasks,, enabling\nML- and domain-experts alike to rapidly build grounded\nAI systems at a high level of abstraction and with lower\ndeployment overheads and annotation costs.\nFigure 1 begins to illustrate the power of retrieval-\naugmented in-context learning,, but also the limitations of\n“retrieve-then-read” (Lazaridou et al.,, 2022; Izacard et al.,,\n2022). Our query is “How many storeys are in the castle\nDavid Gregory inherited?” When prompted to answer this,,\nGPT-3.5 ( text-davinci-002 ; Ouyang et al. 2022) makes\nup a ﬁctitious castle with incorrect attributes,, highlighting\nthe common observation that knowledge stored in LM pa-\nrameters is often unreliable (Shuster et al.,, 2021; Ishii et al.,,\n2022).

Finally,, the P REDICT stage uses the demonstration and retrieved passages to answer the question.\nretrieve-then-read strategy fails because the RM cannot ﬁnd\npassages that directly answer the question.\nWe introduce the DEMONSTRATE –SEARCH –PREDICT\n(DSP ) framework for in-context learning,, which relies en-\ntirely on passing natural language text (and scores) be-\ntween a frozen RM and LM.DSP introduces a num-\nber of composable functions that bootstrap training exam-\nples ( DEMONSTRATE ),, gather information from a knowl-\nedge corpus ( SEARCH ),, and generate grounded outputs\n(PREDICT ),, using them to systematically unify techniques\nfrom the retrieval-augmented NLP and the in-context learn-\ning literatures (Lee et al.,, 2019; Khattab et al.,, 2021a; Anan-\ntha et al.,, 2020; Gao et al.,, 2022; Izacard et al.,, 2022; Dohan\net al.,, 2022; Zelikman et al.,, 2022; Zhang et al.,, 2022).\nWe use DSP to suggest powerful strategies for knowledge-\nintensive tasks with compositions of these techniques. This\nreveals new conceptual possibilities for in-context learning\nin general (§2),, and it allows us to present rich programs\nthat set new state-of-the-art results (§3).\nFigure 1 shows the path that a DSP program might take to\narrive at an answer,, and Figure 2 illustrates how a deliberate\nprogram achieves this. Instead of asking the LMto answer\nthis complex question,, the program’s SEARCH stage uses the\nLMto generate a query “Which castle did David Gregory\ninherit?” The RM retrieves a passage saying Gregory inher-\nited the Kinnairdy Castle. After a second search “hop” ﬁnds\nthe castle’s number of storeys,, the PREDICT stage queries\ntheLM with these passages to answer the original question.\nAlthough this program implements behaviors such as query\ngeneration,, it requires no hand-labeled examples of these\nintermediate transformations (i.e.,, of the queries and pas-\nsages of both retrieval hops). Instead,, the DEMONSTRATEstage uses labeled question–answer pairs to implement a\nform of weak supervision that programmatically annotates\nthe transformations invoked within SEARCH andPREDICT .\nWe evaluate several DSP programs on answering questions\nin open-domain,, multi-hop,, and conversational settings. In\nthem,, we implement novel and reusable transformations\nsuch as bootstrapping annotations for all of our pipelines\nwith weak supervision (§2.3),, reliably rewriting questions to\nresolve conversational dependencies and iteratively decom-\npose complex queries with summarization of intermediate\nhops (§2.4),, and generating grounded responses from mul-\ntiple passages with self-consistency (§2.5). We report pre-\nliminary results on Open-SQuAD,, HotPotQA,, and QReCC\nusing the frozen LMGPT-3.5 and RM ColBERTv2 (Khat-\ntab & Zaharia,, 2020; Santhanam et al.,, 2022b) with no\nﬁne-tuning. Our DSP programs deliver 37–120%,, 8–39%,,\nand 80–290% relative gains against corresponding vanilla\nLMs,, a standard retrieve-then-read pipeline,, and a contem-\nporaneous self-ask pipeline (Press et al.,, 2022),, respectively.\nFuture versions of this report will include additional test\ntasks and LMchoices.\nIn summary,, this work makes the following contributions.\nFirst,, we argue that simple task-agnostic pipelines for in-\ncontext learning should give way to deliberate,, task-aware\nstrategies. Second,, we show that this shift need not be a\nburden: with DSP ,, such strategies can be easily expressed\nas short programs using composable operators. Third,, this\ncomposability spawns powerful capacities,, like automati-\ncally annotating demonstrations for complex pipelines from\nend-task labels. Fourth,, for three knowledge-intensive tasks,,\nwe implement rich programs that establish state-of-the-art\nresults for in-context learning.\n\nDEMONSTRATE –SEARCH –PREDICT : Composing retrieval and language models\n2. D EMONSTRATE –SEARCH –PREDICT\nWe now introduce the DSP framework and show its expres-\nsive power by suggesting a number of strategies in which\ntheLM andRM can come together to tackle complex prob-\nlems effectively. We show in §3 that such strategies out-\nperform existing in-context learning methods. We begin by\ndiscussing the LMandRM foundation modules on which\nDSP is built (§2.1) and then the datatypes and control ﬂow\nwithin DSP (§2.2). Subsequently,, we discuss each of the\nthree inference stages: DEMONSTRATE (§2.3),, SEARCH\n(§2.4),, and P REDICT (§2.5).\n2.1. Pretrained Modules: LM and RM\nADSP program deﬁnes the communication between the\nlanguage model LMand the retrieval model RM.\nLanguage Model We invoke a frozen language model\nLM to conditionally generate (orscore ) text. For each\ninvocation,, the program prepares a prompt that adapts the\nLM to a speciﬁc function (e.g.,, answering questions or\ngenerating queries). A prompt often includes instructions,,\na few demonstrations of the desired behavior,, and an input\nquery to be answered.\nAs in Figure 2,, the LM generates not only: (i)the ﬁnal\nanswer to the input question (in the PREDICT stage),, but also\n(ii)intermediate “hop” queries to ﬁnd useful information\nfor the input question ( SEARCH ) as well as (iii)exemplar\nqueries that illustrate how to produce queries for questions\nin the training set ( DEMONSTRATE ). This systematic use of\ntheLMis a hallmark of DSP programs.\nRetrieval Model DSP programs also invoke a frozen re-\ntrieval model RM toretrieve the top- kmost “relevant”\ntext sequences for a given query . The RM canindex a\nmassive set of pre-deﬁned passages for scalable search,, and\nthose passages can be updated without changing the retrieval\nparameters. The RM accepts free-form textual inputs and\nspecializes in estimating the relevance (or similarity) of a\ntext sequence to a query.\nAs in Figure 2,, the RM is responsible for retrieving (i)\npassages for each query generated by the LM(during the\nSEARCH stage),, but also (ii)passages that are used within\ndemonstrations ( DEMONSTRATE ). In the latter case,, the\nRM’s contributions are less about providing directly rel-\nevant information to the input question and more about\nhelping the LMadapt to the domain and task.\nThough not utilized in this example,, the RM is also used in\nDSP for functions like retrieving “nearest-neighbor” demon-\nstrations from task training data ( DEMONSTRATE ) and se-\nlecting well-grounded generated sequences from the LM\n(PREDICT ).2.2. Datatypes and Control Flow\nWe have implemented the DSP framework in Python. The\npresent section introduces the core data types and compos-\nable functions provided by the framework. We use illustra-\ntive code snippets to ground the examples,, and to convey\nthe power that comes from being able to express complex\ninteractions between the LMandRM in simple programs.\nThe Example Datatype To conduct a task,, a DSP pro-\ngram manipulates one or more instances of the Example\ndatatype. An Example behaves like a Python dictionary\nwith multiple ﬁelds. The program is typically provided with\na few training examples. The code snippet below illustrates\nthis for multi-hop question answering.\n1from dsp import Example\n2\n3train = [ Example ( question ="" When was the discoverer\nof Palomar 4 born ?"",, answer ="" 1889 ""),,\n4 Example ( question =""In which city did Akeem\nEllis play in 2017? "",, answer ="" Ellesmere Port "")]\nThis snippet contains two labeled examples,, each with a\nmulti-hop question (e.g.,, “In which city did Akeem Ellis\nplay in 2017?”) and its short answer (“Ellesmere Port”).\nArbitrary keys and values are allowed within an Example ,,\nthough typical values are strings or lists of strings.\nIn this task,, we are unlikely to ﬁnd an individual passage\nthat provides the answer to any question. For example,, the\nﬁrst training example can probably be resolved only by ﬁrst\nanswering the question of who discovered Palomar (“Edwin\nHubble”) and then addressing the question of Hubble’s birth\ndate using different evidence passages. We typically assume\nthat the human-labeled training data do notinclude labels\nfor intermediate transformations (e.g.,, queries for individual\nhops) that would be useful for following these steps,, and so\nit is the job of the DSP program to discover these strategies\nvia in-context learning.\nA DSP Program The following code snippet is a com-\nplete program for resolving multi-hop questions like those\nin Figure 1,, with help from train examples like those above.\n1def multihop_program ( question : str ) -> str :\n2 x = Example ( question = question ,, train = train )\n3 x = multihop_demonstrate (x)\n4 x = multihop_search (x)\n5 x = multihop_predict (x)\n6 return x. answer\n7\n8multihop_program ("" How many storeys does the castle\nDavid Gregory inherited have ?"")\n9# => "" five storeys ""\nThe program takes the input (here,, a question) and outputs\nthe system output (its short answer). It starts by creating\nanExample for the input question and assigning the train\nﬁeld to the training set from the previous snippet. Programs\n\nDEMONSTRATE –SEARCH –PREDICT : Composing retrieval and language models\ninvoke and compose DSP primitives (i.e.,, built-in functions)\nto build the DEMONSTRATE ,,SEARCH ,, and PREDICT trans-\nformations that deﬁne the program.\nTransformations A transformation is a function that\ntakes an Example as input and returns an Example ,, pop-\nulating new ﬁelds (or modifying existing ﬁelds) in it. This\nprogram invokes three developer-deﬁned transformations,,\nnamely,, multihop_demonstrate ,,multihop_search ,, and\nmultihop_predict . Transformations may themselves in-\nvoke other transformations,, and they act analogously to\nlayers in standard deep neural network (DNN) program-\nming frameworks such as PyTorch,, except that they pass\ntext data instead of tensors between each other and do not\ninvolve backpropagation.\nWe categorize transformations according to their behavior\n(or purpose) under one of the DEMONSTRATE ,,SEARCH ,,\nandPREDICT stages. That said,, DSP does not impose this\ncategorization and allows us to deﬁne functions that may\nblend these stages. We will discuss each of the three stages\nnext.\n2.3. D EMONSTRATE\nIt is known that including examples of the desired behavior\nfrom the LMin its prompt typically leads to better perfor-\nmance (Brown et al.,, 2020). In DSP ,, ademonstration is a\ntraining example that has been prepared to illustrate speciﬁc\ndesired behaviors from the LM. ADEMONSTRATE transfor-\nmation takes as input xof type Example and prepares a list\nof demonstrations in x.demos ,, typically by selecting a sub-\nset of the training examples in x.train andbootstrapping\nnew ﬁelds in them.\nBootstrapping Demonstrations Examples in the train-\ning set typically consist of the input text and the target\noutput of the task. The DEMONSTRATE stage can aug-\nment a training example by programmatically bootstrapping\nannotations for intermediate transformations. In our run-\nning “multi-hop” example,, the demonstrations illustrate\nthree LM-based transformations: (i)how to break down the\ninput question in order to gather information for answer-\ning it (i.e.,, ﬁrst-hop retrieval),, (ii)how to use information\ngathered in an earlier “hop” to ask follow-up questions,, and\n(iii)how to use the information gathered to answer complex\nquestions.\n1Examples = list [ Example ]\n2Transformation = Callable [[ Example ],,\n3 Optional [ Example ]]\n4\n5annotate ( train : Examples ,, fn: Transformation )\n6 -> Examples\nAkin to a specialized map,, the annotate primitive accepts\na user-deﬁned transformation fnand applies it over a listof training examples. Whenever fnreturns an example\n(rather than None ),,annotate caches the intermediate pre-\ndictions (i.e.,, the generated queries and retrieved passages).\nThese predictions serve as successful demonstrations for the\npipeline transformations. In simple uses,, fnmay attempt\nto answer the example “zero-shot” one or more times. This\nis typically done by invoking the SEARCH andPREDICT\nstages of the program. When an answer is produced,, if\nfnassesses it as correct,, it returns a populated example in\nwhich the intermediate predictions are present.\nCase Study The snippet below deﬁnes the func-\ntion multihop_demonstrate ,, called in Line 3 of\nmultihop_program ,, and illustrates the usage of annotate .\n1from dsp import sample ,, annotate\n2\n3def attempt_example (d: Example ):\n4 d = d. copy ( demos =[])\n5 d = multihop_search (d)\n6 d = multihop_predict (d)\n7 return d if d. pred == d. answer else None\n8\n9def multihop_demonstrate (x: Example ):\n10 demos = annotate (x.train ,, attempt_example )\n11 return Example (x,, demos = demos )\nIn Line 10,, multihop_demonstrate invokes annotate ,,\nwhich bootstraps missing ﬁelds in training examples by\ncaching annotations from attempt_example . The transfor-\nmation attempt_example takes a training example dand\nattempts to answer it in a zero-shot fashion: it creates a copy\nofdwith no demonstrations (Line 4; i.e.,, zero-shot) and\ninvokes the multi-hop search and predict pipeline (Lines 5\nand 6). Each transformation returns an updated version of\ndwith additional ﬁelds populated. If the pipeline answers\ncorrectly (Line 7),, the updated dis returned.\nFigure 2 illustrates this behavior. DEMONSTRATE trans-\nforms a training question–answer pair to a fully-populated\ndemonstration,, including ﬁelds such as hop1 andhop2 (i.e.,,\nqueries for multi-hop search) as well as psg1 andpsg2 .\nWhen the LMis later invoked to conduct a transformation,,\nsay,, generating a “second-hop” query during SEARCH ,, the\npsg1 ﬁeld serves as context and the hop2 ﬁeld serves as a\nlabel for this particular training example.\nDiscussion This simple case study illustrates the power of\ncomposition in the DSP abstraction. Because the pipeline\nis a well-deﬁned program in which transformations com-\nmunicate by passing text attached to Example s,, a simple\nmap-and-ﬁlter strategy can leverage the LM andRM to\nbootstrap annotations for a full pipeline from end-task la-\nbels. This is an extensible strategy,, but even in its simplest\nform it generalizes the approaches explored recently by Ze-\nlikman et al. (2022),, Wei et al. (2022),, Zhang et al. (2022),,\nand Huang et al. (2022) in which an LM self-generates\nchain-of-thought rationales for an individual prompt.\n\nDEMONSTRATE –SEARCH –PREDICT : Composing retrieval and language models\nBy bootstrapping pipelines,, DEMONSTRATE makes it easy\nto explore complex strategies in SEARCH andPREDICT\nwithout writing examples for every transformation. This\nincludes strategies that are challenging to explore without\ncustom annotations in traditional retrieval-augmented NLP.\nFor instance,, Khattab et al. (2021a) introduces a pipeline\nfor multi-hop reasoning that is trained with weak supervi-\nsion,, extending work by Lee et al. (2019) and Khattab et al.\n(2021b). In it,, the target 3 or 4 passages that need to re-\ntrieved must be labeled but the system discovers the best\norder of “hops” automatically.\nIn contrast,, DSP allows us to build complex pipelines with-\nout labels for intermediate steps,, because we can compose\nprograms out of small transformations. If LMandRM can\naccurately process such transformations “zero-shot” (i.e.,,\nwithout demonstrations) on at least one or two examples,,\nthese examples can be discovered with end-task labels and\nused as demonstrations.\nTo draw on our earlier analogy with DNN frameworks like\nPyTorch,, DEMONSTRATE aims to replace the function of\nbackpropagation in extensible ways by simulating the be-\nhavior of the program (corresponding to a “forward” pass)\nand programmatically learning from errors. In doing this\nwith frozen models and with only end-task labels,, DEMON -\nSTRATE introduces a high degree of modularity. In partic-\nular,, without hand-labeling intermediate transformations,,\ndevelopers may swap the training domain,, update the train-\ning examples,, or modify the program’s strategy,, and use\nannotate to automatically populate all of the intermediate\nﬁelds for demonstrations.\nSelecting Demonstrations It is not always possible to ﬁt\nall of the training examples in the context window of the\nLM.DSP provides three primitives for selecting a subset\nof training examples,, namely,, sample ,,knn,, and crossval .\n1sample ( train : Examples ,, k: int )\n2 -> Examples\n3\n4knn ( train : Examples ,, cast : Callable [[ Example ],, str ])\n5 -> fn( example : Example ,, k: int ) # currying\n6 -> Examples\n7\n8crossval ( train : Examples ,, n: int ,, k: int )\n9 -> fn( evaluate : Transformation )\n10 -> Examples\nAs a baseline choice,, kdemonstrations can be randomly\nsampled from train using the sample primitive,, an ap-\nproach used by Brown et al. (2020) and much subsequent\nwork. We can also leverage the RM’s representations and se-\nlect from the training set the knearest neighbors to the input\ntext,, a strategy explored by Liu et al. (2021). Another strat-\negy is to apply cross-validation to select among a number of\nsampled sets of demonstrations (Perez et al.,, 2021). For ex-\nample,, given |train |= 100 training examples,, crossvalwould select nsubsets of k= 5examples each,, and return\nthe set with which a transformation evaluate performs best\non the remaining 95examples.\nCompositions & Extensions By manipulating demon-\nstrations and higher-order transformations,, these simple\nselection and bootstrapping primitives can be combined to\nconduct larger novel strategies. If the training set is very\nlarge (e.g.,, |train |= 100 ,,000),, we can conduct knnto\nﬁnd the nearest k= 16 examples and only annotate these,,\narriving at a system that learns incrementally in real-time. If\nthe training set is moderately large (e.g.,, |train |= 1000 ),,\nwe can conduct crossval and cache the performance of all\nprompts it evaluates on each training example. At test time,,\nwe can use knnto ﬁnd k= 50 similar examples to the test\ninput and select the prompt that performs best on these k\nexamples,, producing an adaptive system that is informed by\nthe quality of its pipeline on different types of examples.\n2.4. S EARCH\nTheSEARCH stage gathers passages to support transforma-\ntions conducted by the LM. We assume a large knowledge\ncorpus—e.g.,, a snippet of Web,, Wikipedia,, or arXiv—that\nis divided into text passages . Providing passages to the LM\nfacilitates factual responses,, enables updating the knowl-\nedge store without retraining,, and presents a transparency\ncontract: when in doubt,, users can check whether the system\nhas faithfully used a reliable source in making a prediction.\nIn the simplest scenarios,, SEARCH can directly query the\nRM,, requesting the top- kpassages (from a pre-deﬁned in-\ndex) that match an input question. This baseline instantia-\ntion of SEARCH simulates retrieval in most open-domain\nquestion answering systems,, which implement a “retrieve-\nthen-read” pipeline,, like Lee et al. (2019),, Khattab et al.\n(2021b),, Lazaridou et al. (2022),, and many others.\n1from dsp import retrieve\n2\n3def simple_search (x):\n4 passages = retrieve ( query =x. question ,, k =2)\n5 return passages\nSEARCH Strategies In many scenarios,, the complexity\nof the task demands more sophisticated SEARCH strategies\nthat empower the RM to ﬁnd relevant passages. Our run-\nning example (Figure 2) is one such scenario,, in which we\nsuspect examples are likely to require multi-hop reasoning\nin particular. Other settings,, for instance,, pose conversa-\ntional challenges,, in which the information need expressed\nby a user can only be resolved by taking into account pre-\nvious turns in the conversation,, or demand more extensive\nplanning (Zhong et al.,, 2022).\nIn the retrieval-augmented NLP literature,, multi-hop\nsearch (Xiong et al.,, 2020; Khattab et al.,, 2021a) and con-\n\nDEMONSTRATE –SEARCH –PREDICT : Composing retrieval and language models\nversational search (Del Tredici et al.,, 2021; Raposo et al.,,\n2022) pipelines have received much attention. These sys-\ntems are typically ﬁne-tuned with many hand-labeled query\n“rewrites” (Anantha et al.,, 2020),, “decompositions” (Geva\net al.,, 2021; Min et al.,, 2019),, or target hops (Yang et al.,,\n2018; Jiang et al.,, 2020). Supported with automatic anno-\ntations from D EMONSTRATE ,, the S EARCH stage allows us\nto simulate many such strategies and many others in terms\nof passing queries,, passages,, and demonstrations between\ntheRM andLM. More importantly,, SEARCH facilitates our\nvision of advanced strategies in which the LMandRM co-\noperate to incrementally plan a research path for which the\nRM gathers information and the LMidentiﬁes next steps.\nCase Study Let us build on our running multi-hop exam-\nple as a case study. We can deﬁne multihop_search_v2\n(Line 4 in our core program),, a slightly more advanced ver-\nsion of the SEARCH transformation from Figure 2. This\ntransformation simulates the iterative retrieval component\nof ﬁne-tuned retrieval-augmented systems like IRRR (Qi\net al.,, 2020),, which reads a retrieved passage in every hop\nand generates a search query (or a termination condition to\nstop hopping),, and Baleen (Khattab et al.,, 2021a),, which\nsummarizes the information from many passages in each\nhop for inclusion in subsequent hops.\n1from dsp import generate\n2\n3def multihop_search_v2 (x,, max_hops =3) :\n4 x. hops = []\n5\n6 for hop in range ( max_hops ):\n7 summary ,, query = generate ( hop_template )(x)\n8 x. hops . append (( summary ,, query ))\n9\n10 if query == /quotesingle.VarN/A/quotesingle.Var: break\n11\n12 passages = retrieve (query ,, k =5)\n13 x. context = [ summary ] + passages\n14\n15 return x\nInmultihop_search_v2 ,, Line 7 calls the generate prim-\nitive,, which invokes the LM to produce a query for each\nretrieval hop. The LM is conditioned on a prompt that is\nprepared using the hop_template template. (We discuss\nprompt templates and the generate primitive in §2.5.) Here,,\nthis template may be designed to generate a prompt that has\nthe following format (e.g.,, for the second hop).\n1My task is to write a simple query that gathers\ninformation for answering a complex question . I\nwrite N/A if the context contains all\ninformation required .\n2\n3{ Task demonstrations from x.demos ,, if any }\n4\n5Context : {x. context }\n6Question : {x. question }\n7Summary : Let /quotesingle.Vars summarize the above context .\n__{ summary }__\n8Search Query : __{ query }__As shown,, the LM is instructed to read the context re-\ntrieved in earlier hops and a complex question. It is then\nprompted to write: (i)a summary of the supplied con-\ntext and (ii)a search query that gathers information for\nanswering that question. The generated text will be ex-\ntracted and assigned to the summary andquery variables in\n(multihop_search_v2 ; Line 7). On Line 10,, we terminate\nthe hops if the query is “N/A”. Otherwise,, Line 12 retrieves\nk= 5 passages using the query and Line 13 assigns the\ncontext for the subsequent hop (or for PREDICT ),, setting\nthat to include the summary of all previous hops as well as\nthe passages retrieved in the ﬁnal hop so far.\nComparison with self-ask It may be instructive to con-\ntrast this multi-hop DSP program with the recent “self-\nask” (Press et al.,, 2022) prompting technique,, which we\ncompare against in §3. Self-ask can be thought of as a sim-\nple instantiation of DSP ’sSEARCH stage. In it,, the LMasks\none or more “follow-up questions”,, which are intercepted\nand sent to a search engine. The search engine’s answers\nare concatenated into the prompt and are used to answer\nthe question. This is essentially a simpliﬁed simulation of\nIRRR (Qi et al.,, 2020).\nAs a general framework,, DSP can express ideas like self-ask\nand many other,, more sophisticated pipelines as we discuss\nin the present section. More importantly,, DSP offers a num-\nber of intrinsic advantages that lead to large empirical gains:\n80%–290% over self-ask. For instance,, DSP programs are\ndeeply modular,, which among other things means that DSP\nprograms will annotate and construct their own demonstra-\ntions. Thus,, they can be developed without labeling any\nof the intermediate transformations (e.g.,, the queries gener-\nated). In addition,, the LM prompts constructed by DSP get\nautomatically updated to align with the training data and re-\ntrieval corpus provided. In contrast,, approaches like self-ask\nrely on a hand-written prompt with hard-coded examples.\nMoreover,, DSP assigns the control ﬂow to an explicit pro-\ngram and facilitates design patterns that invoke the LM(or\nRM) to conduct small transformations. This allows us to\nbuild steps that are dedicated to generating one or more re-\ntrieval queries,, summarizing multiple passages per hop,, and\nanswering questions. These steps are individually simpler\nthan the self-ask prompt,, yet our multi-hop DSP program\ndeliberately composes them to build richer pipelines that are\nthus more reliable. In contrast,, self-ask delegates the con-\ntrol ﬂow to the LMcompletions,, maintaining state within\nthe prompt itself and intercepting follow-up questions to\nconduct search. We ﬁnd that this paradigm leads to a “self-\ndistraction” problem (§3.5) that DSP programs avoid.\nFusing Retrieval Results For improved recall and robust-\nness,, we can also fuse the retrieval across multiple gen-\nerated queries. Fusion has a long history in information\n\nDEMONSTRATE –SEARCH –PREDICT : Composing retrieval and language models\nretrieval (Fox & Shaw,, 1994; Xue & Croft,, 2013; Kur-\nland & Culpepper,, 2018) and sequentially processing multi-\nple queries was explored recently by Gao et al. (2022) for\nretroactively attributing text generated by LMs to citations.\nInspired by these,, we include a fused_retrieval primitive\ntoDSP to offer a versatile mechanism for interacting with\nfrozen retrievers. It accepts an optional fusion function that\nmaps multiple retrieval lists into one. By default,, DSP uses\na variant of CombSUM (Fox & Shaw,, 1994),, assigning each\npassage the sum of its probabilities across retrieval lists.\nTo illustrate,, the modiﬁcation below generates n= 10\nqueries for the transformation multihop_search_v2 .\nc = generate ( hop_template ,, n =10) (x)\npassages = fused_retrieval (c. queries ,, k =5)\nsummary = c. summaries [0] # highest - scoring summary\nCompositions & Extensions To illustrate a simple com-\nposition,, we can equip a chatbot with the capacity for con-\nversational multi-hop search by combining a query rewriting\nstep,, which produces a query that encompasses all of the\nrelevant conversational context,, with the multi-hop transfor-\nmation,, as follows.\n1def conversational_multihop_search (x):\n2 x. question = generate ( conv_rewriting_template )(x)\n3 return multihop_search_v2 (x)\nSimilar approaches can be used for correcting spelling mis-\ntakes or implementing pseudo-relevance feedback (Cao\net al.,, 2008; Wang et al.,, 2022a),, in which retrieved passages\nare used to inform a better search query,, though this has not\nbeen attempted with pretrained LMs to our knowledge.\n2.5. P REDICT\nThe PREDICT stage generates the system output using\ndemonstrations (e.g.,, in x.demos ) and passages (e.g.,, in\nx.context ).PREDICT tackles the challenges of reliably\nsolving the downstream task,, which integrates much of the\nwork on in-context learning in general. Within DSP ,, it also\nhas the more specialized function of systematically aggre-\ngating information across a large number of demonstrations,,\npassages,, and candidate predictions.\nGenerating Candidates Generally,, PREDICT has to pro-\nduce one or more candidate predictions for the end-task.\nTo this end,, the basic primitive in PREDICT isgenerate ,,\nwhich accepts a Template and (via currying) an Example\nand queries the LM to produce one or more completions,,\nas explored earlier in §2.4. A corresponding primitive that\nuses the RM in this stage is rank ,, which accepts a query\nand one or more passages and returns their relevance scores.1Template # template : an object that can produce\nprompts and parse completions\n2\n3generate ( template : Template )\n4 -> fn( example : Example )\n5 -> Completions # object with keys to access\nextracted preds and scores\n6\n7rank ( query : str ,, passages : List [ str ])\n8 -> List [ float ] # object with keys to access\npassage texts and scores\nATemplate is an object that can produce prompts,, that is,,\nmap an Example to a string,, and extract ﬁelds out of com-\npletions. For instance,, we can map an example xthat has a\nquestion and retrieved passages to the following prompt:\n1My task is to answer questions using Web documents .\n2\n3{ Task demonstrations from x.demos ,, if any }\n4\n5Context : {x. passage }\n6Question : {x. question }\n7Rationale : Let /quotesingle.Vars think step by step . __{ rationale }__\n8Answer : __{ answer }__\nAs this illustrates,, the LMwill be asked to generate a chain-\nof-thought rationale (CoT; Wei et al. 2022; Kojima et al.\n2022) and an answer,, and the generated text will be ex-\ntracted back into the rationale andanswer keys of each\ncompletion.\nEach invocation to the LMcan sample multiple candidate\npredictions. Selecting a “best” prediction is the subject of\nmuch work on decoding (Wiher et al.,, 2022; Li et al.,, 2022),,\nbut a frozen and general-purpose LMmay not support cus-\ntom modiﬁcations to decoding. Within these constraints,, we\npresent several high-level strategies for selecting predictions\nand aggregating information in DSP via the LMandRM.\nSelecting Predictions Among multiple candidates,, we\ncan simply extract the most popular prediction. When a CoT\nis used to arrive at the answer,, this is the self-consistency\nmethod of Wang et al. (2022c),, which seeks to identify\npredictions at which multiple distinct rationales arrive.\n1from dsp import generate ,, majority\n2\n3def multihop_predict (x):\n4 candidates = generate ( template_qa )(x)\n5 return x. copy ( answer = majority ( candidates ). answer )\nDSP generalizes this in two ways. First,, we can sample\nmultiple “pipelines of transformations” (PoT) within the pro-\ngram,, rather than locally with “chains of thought” (CoT) in\none transformation. These chains may even invoke different\npaths in the program,, as illustrated below.\n\nDEMONSTRATE –SEARCH –PREDICT : Composing retrieval and language models\n1from dsp import branch\n2\n3def pipeline (x):\n4 return multihop_predict ( multihop_search_v2 (x))\n5\n6def PoT_program ( question : str ) -> str :\n7 x = Example ( question = question ,, train = train )\n8 x = multihop_demonstrate (x)\n9\n10 candidates = branch ( pipeline ,, n=5,, t =0.7) (x)\n11 return x. copy ( answer = majority ( candidates ). answer )\nIn the snippet above,, Line 10 invokes the primitive branch\nwhich samples ndifferent PoTs with a high temperature\n(e.g.,, t= 0.7) and accumulates their intermediate and\nﬁnal predictions. In this example,, our pipeline invokes\nmultihop_search_v2 (§2.4),, which applies a variable num-\nber of retrieval hops depending on the questions generated,,\nbefore doing PREDICT . That is,, PoT_program potentially\ninvokes multiple distinct paths in the program (i.e.,, with dif-\nferent multi-hop queries and number of hops in each) across\nbranches. It then selects the majority answer overall.\nDSP generalizes self-consistency in a second way. When\nsampling our CoTs or PoTs provides multiple candidates,,\nwe can select the top- k(e.g.,, top-4) predictions and then\ncompare them directly. For instance,, we may prompt the\nLMto compare these choices as MCQ candidates,, a trans-\nformation for which DEMONSTRATE can automatically pre-\npare exemplars. This effectively simulates the LM recursion\nof Levine et al. (2022),, though unlike their approach it does\nnot require a large training set or updating any (prompt-\ntuning) weights. One such implementation is illustrated in\nopenqa_predict below.\n1def openqa_predict (x):\n2 preds = generate ( template_qa ,, n =20) (x). answers\n3 x. choices = most_common (preds ,, k =4)\n4\n5 queries = [f""{x. question } {c}""\n6 for c in x. choices ]\n7\n8 x. passages = fused_retrieval ( queries )\n9 x. answer = generate ( TemplateMCQ )(x). answer\n10 return x\nAs an alternative comparison approach,, we can invoke the\nRM viarank to ﬁnd the prediction that is most grounded in\na retrieved contexts (i.e.,, most similar to the concatenation\nof the retrieved passages) or,, given an RM that can score\ncompletions (Krishna et al.,, 2022),, simply the prediction\nthat has the highest score given the prompt.\nAggregating Information When only a few demonstra-\ntions or passages are selected,, we can simply concate-\nnate them all into the prompt. For instance,, GPT-3.5\ntext-davinci-002 has a context window of 4097 tokens,,\nwhich we ﬁnd to be reasonably large for accommodating\nseveral (e.g.,, 3–5) demonstrations,, which individually in-\nclude their own passages and rationales.To deal with a larger number of demonstrations or passages,,\nwe can branch in parallel to process individual subsets\nof the passages or demonstrations and then aggregate the\nindividual answers using one of the scoring methods pre-\nsented earlier. Indeed,, Lewis et al. (2020) and Lazaridou\net al. (2022) have explored marginalization as a way to com-\nbine scores across passages and Le et al. (2022) ensemble\nprompts across demonstrations,, which can be expressed in\nthis way.\nAn alternative aggregation strategy is to accumulate informa-\ntion across passages sequentially,, rather than independently.\nThis is effectively how our multi-hop approach works (§2.4).\nSuch a strategy has also been employed recently by Gao\net al. (2022) for retroactively attributing text generated by\nLMs to citations. They generate many queries but instead\nof fusion (§2.4),, they run their pipeline on each query and\nuse its outputs to alter the input to subsequent queries.1\n3. Evaluation\nWe now consider how to implement DSP programs for three\ndiverse knowledge-intensive NLP tasks: open-domain ques-\ntion answering (QA),, multi-hop QA,, and conversational QA.\nAll of these tasks are “open-domain”,, in the sense that sys-\ntems are given a short question or participate in a multi-turn\nconversation without being granted access to context that\nanswers these questions.\nWe build and evaluate intuitive compositions of the func-\ntions explored in §2 for each task. We show that,, despite\nlow development effort,, the resulting DSP programs exhibit\nstrong quality and deliver considerable empirical gains over\nvanilla in-context learning and a standard retrieve-then-read\npipeline with in-context learning.\n3.1. Evaluation Methodology\nIn this report,, we consider one development dataset for each\nof the tasks we consider,, namely,, the open-domain version\nof SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al.,, 2016; Lee et al.,, 2019),, the\nmulti-hop HotPotQA (Yang et al.,, 2018) dataset in the open-\ndomain “fullwiki” setting,, and the conversational question\nanswering QReCC (Anantha et al.,, 2020; Vakulenko et al.,,\n2022) dataset,, which we used for developing the DSP ab-\nstractions. We report the validation set accuracy on all three\ndatasets and discuss them in detail §3.5.\nUnless otherwise stated,, systems are given access to 16-\nshot training examples,, that is,, each DSP program can use\n(up to) 16 questions—or conversations,, where applicable—\nrandomly sampled from the respective training set. We\n1Though most of the functionality in this section is imple-\nmented,, the primitives branch ,,knn,, and crossval are currently\nwork-in-progress.\n\nDEMONSTRATE –SEARCH –PREDICT : Composing retrieval and language models\nsubsample the validation and test sets to 1000 questions\n(or 400 conversations,, where applicable) and report average\nquality across ﬁve seeds where each seed ﬁxes a single k-\nshot training set of examples. To control the language model\nAPI spending budget,, each seed processes one ﬁfth of the\nevaluation examples (e.g.,, 200 questions per seed,, for a total\nof 1000 unique questions).\nWe also dedicate held-out test datasets (e.g.,, Open-\nNaturalQuestions; Kwiatkowski et al. 2019) and test tasks\n(e.g.,, claim veriﬁcation,, as in FEVER; Thorne et al. 2018)\nthat we only use for evaluating pre-deﬁned DSP programs\nrather than development. We will include these results in a\nfuture version of this report.\n3.2. Pretrained Modules\nRM We use ColBERTv2 (Santhanam et al.,, 2022b),, a\nstate-of-the-art retriever based on late interaction (Khattab\n& Zaharia,, 2020). We choose ColBERTv2 for its highly\neffective zero-shot search quality and efﬁcient search (San-\nthanam et al.,, 2022a). However,, our DSP programs are\nagnostic to how the retriever represents examples or scores\npassages,, so essentially any retriever can be used.\nIn addition,, by making retrieval a ﬁrst-class construct,, DSP\nallows us to change or update the search index over time.\nWe simulate this in our experiments by aligning each of our\ndatasets with the nearest Wikipedia corpus among the Dec\n2016 Wikipedia dump from Chen et al. 2017,, the Nov 2017\nWikipedia “abstracts” dump from Yang et al. 2018,, and the\nDec 2018 Wikipedia dump from Karpukhin et al. 2020.\nLM We use the GPT-3.5 ( text-davinci-002 ; Brown\net al. 2020; Ouyang et al. 2022) language model. Unless\notherwise stated,, we use greedy decoding when generating\nn= 1 prediction. We sample with temperature t= 0.7\nwhen n > 1,, like related work (Wang et al.,, 2022c).\n3.3. Baselines\nVanilla LM The vanilla LM baselines represent the few-\nshot in-context learning paradigm used by Brown et al.\n(2020). The open-domain QA and multi-hop QA base-\nlines randomly sample 16 demonstrations (i.e.,, all of the\nexamples available to each program in our evaluation) from\nthe training set and do not augment these demonstrations\nwith evidence. Similarly,, the conversational QA baseline\nsamples four conversations. The vanilla baselines do not\nsearch for passages relevant to the input query.\n1def vanilla_LM_QA ( question : str ) -> str :\n2 demos = sample (train ,, k =16)\n3 x = Example ( question = question ,, demos = demos )\n4 return generate ( qa_template )(x). predRetrieve-then-Read The “retrieve-then-read” baselines\nuse the RM to support each example with a potentially rele-\nvant passage before submitting the prompt to the LM. This\nemulates the pipelines used by state-of-the-art open-domain\nquestion answering systems (Khattab et al.,, 2021b; Izacard\n& Grave,, 2020; Hofstätter et al.,, 2022). In conversational\nQA,, we concatenate the ﬁrst turn and the ﬁnal question,, an\napproach that we found to perform much better than simply\nusing the ﬁnal turn. For multi-hop QA,, we retrieve and\nconcatenate two passages per question.\n1def retrieve_then_read_QA ( question : str ) -> str :\n2 demos = sample (train ,, k =16)\n3 passages = retrieve ( question ,, k =1)\n4 x = Example ( question = question ,,\n5 passages = passages ,,\n6 demos = demos )\n7 return generate ( qa_template )(x). pred\nSelf-ask We also compare against self-ask (Press et al.,,\n2022),, a contemporaneous pipeline that can be thought of\nas a speciﬁc instantiation of DSP ’sSEARCH stage followed\nby a simple PREDICT step. For direct comparison with\nour methods,, we modify the self-ask control ﬂow to query\nthe same ColBERTv2 index used in our DSP experiments\ninstead of Google Search. We evaluate two conﬁgurations of\nself-ask. The ﬁrst uses the original self-ask prompt template,,\nwhich contains four hand-written demonstrations. In the\nsecond conﬁguration,, we modify the prompt template to\napply a number of changes that we ﬁnd are empirically\nuseful for HotPotQA.2\n3.4. Proposed DSP Programs\nWe build on transformations presented in §2. Our programs\nfor all three tasks have the following structure,, illustrated\nfor open-domain QA.\n1def openqa_program ( question : str ) -> str :\n2 x = Example ( question = question ,, train = train )\n3 x = openqa_demonstrate (x)\n4 x = openqa_search (x)\n5 x = openqa_predict (x)\n6 return x. answer\nThe exception is that the conversational QA program,,\n2In particular: (i)use ColBERTv2-style passages in the hand-\ncrafted demonstrations of self-ask (i.e.,, instead of the original\nGoogle-style snippets),, (ii)concatenate 16-shot training examples\nfrom the task (i.e.,, question–answer pairs) as a preﬁx of the prompt,,\n(iii)ask the model to generate a short intermediate answer per\nretrieval step,, and (iv)explicitly ask the model to generate a follow-\nup “search query” at each step. We found the ﬁnal item to be\nimportant because self-ask’s default prompt often produces follow-\nup questions that are not self-contained (e.g.,, “what is the name of\nthe national park?”,, which is not an informative search query). We\nalso ﬁx the casing in the prompt to be consistent.\n\nDEMONSTRATE –SEARCH –PREDICT : Composing retrieval and language models\nTable 1. Development results comparing a task-aware DSP program against baseline vanilla LM and retrieve-then-read LM as well as\nrecent and contemporaneous in-context learning approaches with and without retrieval. All of our runs use GPT-3.5 and our retrieval-based\nrows use ColBERTv2. The results marked with¶are collected from related work as of mid-December 2022,, and attributed to their\nindividual sources in the main text. As we discuss in the main text,, the marked results are not generally apples-to-apples comparisons,,\nsince they span a variety of evaluation settings.

For\nPREDICT ,, it generates n= 20 reasoning chains and uses\nself-consistency (SC; Wang et al. 2022c) to select its ﬁnal\nprediction. For DEMONSTRATE ,, our open-domain QA pro-\ngram uses the following approach,, slightly simpliﬁed for\npresentation. In it,, the parameter k= 3passed to annotate\nrequests annotating only three demonstrations,, which will\nthen be used in the prompts.\n1def openqa_demonstrate (x: Example ) -> Example :\n2 demos = sample (x.train ,, k =16)\n3\n4 def openqa_attempt (d: Example ) -> Example :\n5 d. demos = all_but (demos ,, d) # all ( raw )\nexamples different from d\n6\n7 d = openqa_search (d,, k =2)\n8 if not passage_match (d): return None # skip\nexamples where search fails\n9\n10 d = openqa_predict (d,, sc= False )\n11 if not answer_match (d): return None # skip\nexamples where predict fails\n12\n13 return d\n14\n15 x. demos = annotate (demos ,, openqa_attempt ,, k =3)\n16 return x\nOur multi-hop program adopts a very similar approach for\nDEMONSTRATE andPREDICT . For SEARCH ,, it uses the\napproach described in §2.4,, with the following adjustments.\nIt uses result fusion across n= 10 queries per hop and,,\namong the npredictions,, uses the summary corresponding\nto the largest average log-probability. It uses a ﬁxed number\nof hops for HotPotQA,, i.e.,, two hops. In each prompt (i.e.,,each hop and QA),, it concatenates the summaries of all\nprevious hops (i.e.,, hop 1 onwards) and a total of k= 5\npassages divided between the hops (i.e.,, ﬁve passages from\nthe ﬁrst hop or two passages from the ﬁrst and three from\nthe second).\nFor conversational QA,, we use a simple PREDICT which\ngenerates a response with greedy decoding,, conditioned\non all of the previous turns of the conversation and ﬁve\nretrieved passages. For SEARCH ,, our conversational QA\npipeline generates n= 10 re-written queries (and also uses\nthe simple query as the retrieve-and-read baseline; §3.3) and\nfuses them as in §2.4. We implement DEMONSTRATE simi-\nlar to openqa_demonstrate ,, but sample only four examples\n(i.e.,, four conversational turns; instead of 16 questions as in\nopen-domain QA) for demonstrating the task for the higher-\norder transformation convqa_attempt ,, which is passed to\nannotate (not shown for brevity).\n1def convqa_attempt (d: Example ) -> Example :\n2 d. demos = all_but (demos ,, d) # all ( raw )\nexamples that don /quotesingle.Vart intersect with the\nconversation of d\n3\n4 d = convqa_search (d,, k =2)\n5 if max ( precision (d. answer ,, p) for p in\nd. passages ) < .8: return None # skip examples\nwhere search fails\n6\n7 d = convqa_predict (d,, n =20)\n8 if max (F1(c.pred ,, d. answer ) for c in\nd. candidates ) < .75: return None # skip\nexamples where predict fails out of n =20\nattempts\n9\n10 return d\n3.5. Development Datasets & Results\nOpen-SQuAD We conduct the open-domain version of\nSQuAD over the Wikipedia 2016 corpus from Chen et al.\n(2017),, as processed by Khattab et al. (2021b). We use the\n\nDEMONSTRATE –SEARCH –PREDICT : Composing retrieval and language models\nsame train/validation/test splits as in Karpukhin et al. (2020)\nand Khattab et al. (2021b).\nTable 1 reports the answer EM and F1. The task-aware DSP\nprogram achieves 36.6% EM,, outperforming the vanilla LM\nbaseline by 126% EM relative gains. This indicates the im-\nportance of grounding the LM’s predictions in retrieval,, and\nit shows that state-of-the-art retrievers like ColBERTv2 have\nthe capacity to do so off-the-shelf. The proposed DSP pro-\ngram also achieves relative gains of 8% in EM and 6% in F1\nover the retrieve-then-read pipeline,, highlighting that non-\ntrivial gains are possible by aggregating information across\nseveral retrieved passages as we do with self-consistency.\nThese in-context learning results are competitive with a\nnumber of popular ﬁne-tuned systems. For instance,, on\nthe Open-SQuAD test set,, DPR achieves 29.8% EM,, well\nbelow our 16-shot DSP program. On the Open-SQuAD\ndev set,, the powerful Fusion-in-Decoder (Izacard & Grave,,\n2020) “base” approach achieves approximately 36% (i.e.,,\nvery similar quality to our system) when invoked with ﬁve\nretrieved passages. Nonetheless,, with the default setting\nof reading 100 passages,, their system reaches 48% EM in\nthis evaluation. This may indicate that similar gains are\npossible for our DSP program if the PREDICT stage is made\nto aggregate information across many more passages.\nFor comparison,, we also evaluate the self-ask pipeline,,\nwhich achieves 9.3% EM,, suggesting that its ﬁxed pipeline\nis ineffective outside its default multi-hop setting. Study-\ning a few examples of its errors reveals that it often de-\ncomposes questions in tangential ways and answers these\nquestions instead. We refer to this behavior of the LMas\n“self-distraction”,, and we believe it adds evidence in favor of\nour design decisions in DSP . To illustrate self-distraction,,\nwhen self-ask is prompted with “When does The Kidnap-\nping of Edgardo Mortara take place?”,, it asks “What is The\nKidnapping of Edgardo Mortara“ and then asks when it was\npublished,, a tangential question. Thus,, self-ask answers\n“1997”,, instead of the time The Kidnapping of Edgardo\nMortara takes place (1858).\nFor reference,, Table 1 also reports (as No-retrieval LM\nSoTA) the concurrent in-context learning results from Si\net al. (2022) using code-davinci-002 ,, who achieve 20.2%\nEM without retrieval and 34.0% EM with retrieval,, albeit\non a different sample and split of the SQuAD data. Overall,,\ntheir approaches are very similar to the baselines we im-\nplement (vanilla LM and retrieve-then-read),, though their\nretrieval-augmented approach retrieves (and concatenates\ninto the prompt) 10 passages from a Wikipedia dump.\nHotPotQA We use the open-domain “fullwiki” setting\nof HotPotQA using its ofﬁcial Wikipedia 2017 “abstracts”\ncorpus. The HotPotQA test set is hidden,, so we reserve\nthe ofﬁcial validation set for our testing. We sub-dividethe training set into 90%/10% train/validation splits. In the\ntraining (and thus validation) split,, we keep only examples\nmarked as “hard” in the original dataset,, which matches the\ndesignation of the ofﬁcial validation and test sets.\nWe report the ﬁnal answer EM and F1 in Table 1. On\nHotPotQA,, the task-aware DSP program outperforms the\nbaselines and existing work by very wide margins,, exceed-\ning the vanilla LM,, the retrieve-then-read baseline,, and the\nself-ask pipeline by 82%,, 39%,, and 80%,, respectively,, in\nEM. This highlights the effectiveness of building up more\nsophisticated programs that coordinate the LM andRM for\nthe S EARCH step.\nThese results may be pegged against the evaluation on Hot-\nPotQA in a number of concurrent papers. We ﬁrst compare\nwith non-retrieval approaches,, though our comparisons must\nbe tentative due to variation in evaluation methodologies. Si\net al. (2022) achieve 25.2% EM with CoT prompting. With\na “recite-and-answer” technique for PaLM-62B (Chowdh-\nery et al.,, 2022),, Sun et al. (2022) achieve 26.5% EM. Wang\net al. (2022b) achieve 33.8% EM and 44.6 F1 when apply-\ning a self-consistency prompt for PaLM-540B. Next,, we\ncompare with a contemporaneous retrieval-based approach:\nYao et al. (2022) achieve 35.1% EM using a system capable\nof searching using a Wikipedia API. All of these approaches\ntrail our task-aware DSP program,, which achieves 51.4%\nEM,, by large margins.\nQReCC We use QReCC (Anantha et al.,, 2020) in an open-\ndomain setting over Wikipedia 2018. QReCC does not have\nan ofﬁcial development set,, so we sub-divide the training\nset into 90%/10% train/validation splits. For the ﬁrst ques-\ntion in every conversation,, we use the rewritten question\nas the original question often assumes access to a ground-\ntruth document. We also ﬁlter low-quality examples from\nQReCC.3\nWe conduct the QReCC conversations in an auto-regressive\nmanner. At turn t > 1of a particular conversation,, the\nsystem sees its own responses (i.e.,, not the ground truth\nresponses) to previous turns of the conversation. We report\nthe novel-F1 metric (nF1; Paranjape et al. 2022),, which\ncomputes the F1 overlap between the system response and\nthe ground truth while discounting common stopwords and\nterms present in the question (or earlier questions). The\nresults are shown in Table 1,, and follow the same general\npattern as SQuAD and HotPotQA.\n3We remove conversations that have one or more empty ground-\ntruth answers and conversations that have only one or two ques-\ntions. We also ﬁnd many conversations that include “what other\ninteresting facts are in this article?”,, which conﬂict with the open-\ndomain formulation and have no well-deﬁned answer. Hence,, we\nremove any conversation that includes the keywords “other inter-\nesting” or “else”,, which we found to be markers of low quality.\n\nDEMONSTRATE –SEARCH –PREDICT : Composing retrieval and language models\n4. Conclusion\nFor a long time,, the dominant paradigm for building models\nin AI has centered around multiplication of tensor repre-\nsentations,, and in the deep learning era this has given rise\nto highly modular (layer-wise) designs that allow for fast\ndevelopment and wide exploration. However,, these design\nparadigms require extensive domain expertise,, and even\nexperts face substantial challenges when it comes to com-\nbining different pretrained components into larger systems.\nThe promise of in-context learning is that we can build com-\nplex systems from pretrained components using only natural\nlanguage as the medium for giving systems instructions and,,\nas we argue for,, allowing components to communicate with\neach other. In this new paradigm,, the building blocks are\npretrained models and the core operations are natural lan-\nguage instructions and operations on natural language texts.\nIf we can realize this potential,, then we can broaden partici-\npation in AI system development,, rapidly prototype systems\nfor new domains,, and maximize the value of specialized\npretrained components.\nIn the current paper,, we introduced the DEMONSTRATE –\nSEARCH –PREDICT (DSP ) framework for retrieval aug-\nmented in-context learning. DSP consists of a number of\nsimple,, composable functions for implementing in-context\nlearning systems as deliberate programs —instead of end-\ntask prompts—for solving knowledge intensive tasks. We\nimplemented DSP as a Python library and used it to write\nprograms for Open-SQuAD,, HotPotQA,, and QReCC. These\nprograms deliver substantial gains over previous in-context\nlearning approaches. However,, beyond any particular per-\nformance number,, we argue that the central contribution of\nDSP is in helping to reveal a very large space of conceptual\npossibilities for in-context learning in general.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Ashwin Paranjape,, Amir Ziai,, and Rick Battle for\nvaluable discussions and feedback.

We review the cost associated with querying popular LLM APIs—e.g. GPT-4,, ChatGPT,,\nJ1-Jumbo—and ﬁnd that these models have heterogeneous pricing structures,, with fees that can\ndiﬀer by two orders of magnitude. In particular,, using LLMs on large collections of queries and\ntext can be expensive. Motivated by this,, we outline and discuss three types of strategies that\nusers can exploit to reduce the inference cost associated with using LLMs: 1) prompt adaptation,,\n2) LLM approximation,, and 3) LLM cascade. As an example,, we propose FrugalGPT,, a simple yet\nﬂexible instantiation of LLM cascade which learns which combinations of LLMs to use for diﬀerent\nqueries in order to reduce cost and improve accuracy. Our experiments show that FrugalGPT can\nmatch the performance of the best individual LLM (e.g. GPT-4) with up to 98% cost reduction or\nimprove the accuracy over GPT-4 by 4% with the same cost. The ideas and ﬁndings presented\nhere lay a foundation for using LLMs sustainably and eﬃciently.\n1 Introduction\nWe are in the midst of an explosion of large language models (LLMs). The alluring possibilities of\nusing LLMs for large-scale applications such as commerce,, science,, and ﬁnance have led a growing\nnumber of companies (OpenAI,, AI21,, CoHere,, etc.) to oﬀer LLMs as services.\nWhile LLMs such as GPT-4 achieves unprecedented performance in tasks such as question answering,,\nusing them for high-throughput applications can be very expensive. For example,, ChatGPT is estimated\nto cost over $700,,000 per day to operate [ Cosa ],, and using GPT-4 to support customer service can\ncost a small business over $21,,000 a month [ Cosb ]. In addition to the ﬁnancial cost,, using the largest\nLLMs encures substantial environmental and energy impact [ BGMMS21 ,,WRG+22],, aﬀecting the social\nwelfare of current and future generations.\nThere are many LLMs now available via APIs and they charge heterogeneous prices. The cost of\nusing a LLM API typically consists of three components: 1) prompt cost (proportional to the length of\nthe prompt),, 2) generation cost (proportional to the generation length),, and 3) sometimes a ﬁxed cost\nper query. We compared the cost associated with using 12 diﬀerent commercial LLMs from mainstream\nproviders including OpenAI,, AI21,, CoHere and Textsynth (Table 1). Their cost can diﬀer by up to 2\norders of magnitudes: for example,, the prompt cost for 10M tokens is $30 for OpenAI’s GPT-4 but\nonly $0.2 for GPT-J hosted by Textsyth.\nGiven the heterogeneous cost and quality,, how to eﬀectively and eﬃciently leverage the full set of\nLLM options is a key challenge for pracitioners. If the tasks are relatively simple,, then aggregating\nmultiple responses from GPT-J [ WK21 ] (whose size is 30x smaller than GPT-3) oﬀers performance\nsimilar to GPT-3 [ ANC+22],, leading to ﬁnancial and environmental savings. However,, the performance\nof GPT-J can be much worse on diﬃcult tasks [ TLI+23]. Moreover,, relying on one API provider\nis not reliable if that provider becomes unavailable,, potentially due to spiking demand. Existing\nmodel ensemble paradigms such as model cascade [ VJ04 ,,WLM11 ] and FrugalML [ CZZ20 ,,CZZ22 ] were\ndesigned for predictive tasks with a known set of labels and do not account for the full capabilities of\nLLM. How to use LLMs aﬀordably and accurately therefore calls for new approaches.\nOur contributions. In this paper,, we lay out our vision of a ﬂexible framework that uses LLM APIs\nto process natural language queries within a budget constraint,, termed FrugalGPT. As shown in Figure\n1arXiv:2305.05176v1  [cs.LG]  9 May 2023\n\nQuery Answer\n(a) Existing LLM Usage\n(c) Performance and cost tradeoffsLLM ApproximationPrompt  \nAdaptationLLM  \nCascade\nLLM \nApproximationQuery\nBudgetAnswer\n(b) Proposed FrugalGPTGPT-4 ChatGPT GPT-JZero-shot CoT Few-shot ...\n...GPT-Neo\nFSQGPT-J   J1\nJ1-G\nJ1-L CoHere\nFQGPT-3\nChatGPT\nGPT-CGPT-4\n0 10 20 30 400.70.720.740.760.780.80.820.840.860.88 FrugalGPT\nCost ($)AccuracyFigure 1: Our vision for reducing LLM cost while improving accuracy. (a) The standard usage sends\nqueries to a single LLM (e.g. GPT-4),, which can be expensive. (b) Our proposal is to use prompt\nadaption,, LLM approximation and LLM cascade to reduce the inference cost. By optimizing over the\nselection of diﬀerent LLM APIs (e.g.,, GPT-J,, ChatGPT,, and GPT-4) as well as prompting strategies\n(such as zero-shot [ BMR+20],, few-shot [ LSZ+21],, and chain-of-thought(CoT) [ WWS+22]),, we can\nachieve substantial eﬃciency gains. (c) On HEADLINES (a ﬁnancial news dataset),, FrugalGPT can\nreduce the inference cost by 98% while exceeding the performance of the best individual LLM (GPT-4).\n1,, we discuss three main strategies for cost reduction: prompt adaptation ,,LLM approximation ,, and\nLLM cascade . The prompt adaptation explores how to identify eﬀective (often shorter) prompts to save\ncost. LLM approximation aims to create simpler and cheaper LLMs to match a powerful yet expensive\nLLM on speciﬁc tasks. LLM cascade focuses on how to adaptively choose which LLM APIs to use for\ndiﬀerent queries.\nTo illustrate the potential of these ideas,, we implement and evaluate a simple version of FrugalGPT\nusing LLM cascade. On each dataset and task,, FrugalGPT learns how to adaptively triage diﬀerent\nqueries in the dataset to diﬀerent combinations of LLMs,, including ChatGPT [ Cha],, GPT-3 [ BMR+20]\nand GPT-4 [ Ope23 ]. Our experiments show that FrugalGPT can save up to 98% of the inference cost\nof the best individual LLM API while matching its performance on the downstream task. On the other\nhand,, FrugalGPT can improve the performance by up to 4% with the same cost. We believe this is only\nthe tip of the iceberg and we hope FrugalGPT opens a new window toward reducing LLMs’ inference\ncost and improving its performances.\nRelated Works. Prompt Engineering. Prompt engineering has emerged as a discipline for\ncrafting prompts to enhance LLMs’ performance across various applications. Recent developments\ninclude few-shot [ BMR+20],, chain-of-thought [ WWS+22],, knowledge enhancement [ LLL+21,,KSL+22],,\nand numerous other prompting techniques [ MDL+23,,KTF+22,,ZSH+22,,DGSG22 ]. Existing prompt\nengineering approaches often aim to provide more detailed task explanations and in-context examples,,\nresulting in longer and more expensive prompts. In contrast,, this paper explores the use of concise\nprompts to reduce costs.\nModel Ensemble. Model ensembles,, which involve combining multiple ML models for prediction,,\nhave gained popularity in supervised learning [ VJ04 ,,Fri02 ],, unsupervised learning [ YLLL14 ],, semi-\nsupervised learning [ GDMR22 ],, and weakly supervised learning [ DSP+17]. Model ensembles typically\nrequire white-box access to multiple models for training purposes,, but LLM APIs are often black-box.\nMoreover,, model ensembles necessitate querying all models for a single query,, thereby increasing costs.\nSystem Optimization for LLMs. Numerous eﬀorts have aimed to accelerate the training and\ninference time of modern deep learning models through system optimization [ HMD15 ,,CHSV17 ,,Cas19 ,,\nJZA19 ,,RRWN11 ]. Recent work focuses on post-training quantization [ BHS+22,,YLW+23,,XLS+22],,\ntraining pipeline parallelism [ LZG+21],, and hardware-aware pruning [ KFA23 ] tailored for LLMs. System\noptimization requires modiﬁcations to LLMs’ internal states (e.g.,, model weights),, but many commercial\n2\n\nLLM APIs do not release their models. Additionally,, the rapidly increasing size of LLMs renders\nretraining highly expensive.\nML-as-a-Service. LLM APIs constitute a crucial component of the rapidly expanding machine-\nlearning-as-a-service (MLaaS) industry. Recent studies have demonstrated the diversity of diﬀerent ML\nAPIs’ predictions [ BG18 ,,KNL+20,,CCZZ21 ] and proposed strategies for leveraging various classiﬁcation\nML APIs to improve performance [ CZZ20 ,,CZZ22 ]. The outputs of LLM APIs encompass the entire\nnatural language space,, but existing work requires a ﬁxed (and known) label set. Moreover,, both\nprompt choices and LLM API selections signiﬁcantly impact generative tasks’ performance,, resulting in\na considerably larger optimization space than standard classiﬁcation.\nThe remaining part of the paper is organized as follows. We start by oﬀering more context and the\nproblem statement in Section 2. Next in Section 3,, we present our visions on how to use LLM APIs\naﬀordability and accurately. Section 4 shows the empirical beneﬁts of FrugalGPT using real-world LLM\nAPIs (including GPT-3,, ChatGPT,, and GPT-4). Finally,, we discuss future prospects in Section 5.\n2 Scope and Problem Statement\nNatural language query answering. In this paper,, we concentrate on the standard natural\nlanguage query answering task,, where the objective is to answer a query qsampled from a natural\nlanguage query distribution Q. Various real-world natural language tasks,, such as news classiﬁcation,,\nreading comprehension,, and commonsense reasoning,, can be formulated as query-answering problems.\nLLM marketplace. We consider answering queries via the LLM market,, which comprises Kdiﬀerent\nLLM APIs,, denoted by {fi(·)}K\ni=1. Eachfi(·) :P↦→A is a function that,, given a prompt pfrom\nthe prompt space P,, generates an answer from the answer distribution A. Note that to use LLM\nAPIs,, one has to convert each query qto some corresponding prompt ﬁrst. LLM APIs are associated\nwith their own cost,, typically consisting of three components: a portion proportional to the length\nof the prompt,, a portion proportional to the length of the generated answer,, and (sometimes) a\nﬁxed cost per query. Formally,, given a prompt p,, the cost of using the ith LLM API is denoted by\nci(p)≜˜ci,,2∥fi(p)∥+ ˜ci,,1∥p∥+ ˜ci,,0,, where ˜ci,,j,,j= 0,,1,,2 are constants.\nAn illustrative example. Adapting the case study provided by [ Cosa ],, assume a small business\noperates a customer service using GPT-4. The company caters to 15,,000 customers each month,, with\neach customer asking three questions twice a week,, totaling 360,,000 queries per month. Suppose for\neach question,, its corresponding prompt averages 1800 tokens,, and the answer is around 80 tokens.\nConsidering that the input and response costs of GPT-4 are $0.03 and $0.06 per thousand tokens,,\nrespectively,, the total monthly cost amounts to 360 ×($0.03×1800 + $0.06×80)≈$21.2K. Such a\nhigh cost is prohibitive for many small businesses.\nProblem statement: budget-aware LLM API usage. Our primary goal in this paper is lever-\naging LLM APIs within a budget constraint . Formally,, this can be formulated as maximizing the overall\ntask performance E(q,,a)∈Q×A [r(a,,ˆa(s,,q))],, while ensuring the average cost is bounded by a user-deﬁned\nvalueb,, i.e.,, E(q,,a)∈Q×A [c(s,,q)]≤b. Here,,adenotes the correct answer to the query q,,ˆa(s,,q) is the\ngenerated answer by some strategy sfor queryq,, andc(s,,q) is the associated cost for processing query\nqusing strategy s. The reward function r(·,,·) measures how closely the generated answer aligns with\nthe correct one. It is crucial to note that the search space for the strategy is vast,, encompassing factors\nsuch as which prompts to use,, which LLM APIs to employ,, and how to aggregate their responses.\n3 How to Use LLMs Aﬀordably and Accurately\nNow we present our vision on how to use LLM APIs within a budget. As shown in Figure 1 (b),, we\ndiscuss three cost-reduction strategies,, namely,, prompt adaptation,, LLM approximation,, and LLM\ncascade.\n3\n\nFine-T unerQuery ConcatenatorPrompt Selector\nQ1: What is the result of \nand  at high temperatures?  \nQ2: What helps prey hide?\nQ: What helps prey hide?LLM Chain\ncamouflageCache Q':  and  at high temp leads to?\nA': nitrogen oxides\nWhat helps prey hide? camouflage\nWhat is from e cholocation?  sonar\n Q: What is the result of \nand  at high temperatures?(a) Prompt selection\n(b) Query concatenation\n(e) LLM cascade(c) Completion cache\n(d) Model fine-tuning\nscore < 0.5GPT-J GPT-4 GPT-3\ncamouflage camouflage camouflageGPT-4\nGPT-4\nGPT-4\nGPT-4Prompt: Q1+A1,,Q2+A2,,Q3+A3,,Q4+A4\n Q: What is the result of \nand  at high temperatures?

(a) Prompt selection uses a subset of in-context\nexamples as the prompt to reduce the size of the prompt. (b) Query concatenation aggregates multiple\nqueries to share prompts. (c) Completion cache stores and reuses an LLM API’s response when a\nsimilar query is asked. (d) Model ﬁne-tuning uses expensive LLMs’ responses to ﬁne-tune cheap LLMs.\n(e) LLM cascade employs diﬀerent LLM APIs for diﬀerent queries.\n4\n\nStrategy 1: Prompt adaptation. The cost of an LLM query increases linearly with the size of the\nprompt. Consequently,, a logical approach to reduce the cost of using LLM APIs involves decreasing the\nprompt’s size,, a process we refer to as prompt adaptation. Prompt selection (as illustrated in Figure 2\n(a)) is a natural example of prompt adaptation: rather than employing a prompt containing numerous\nexamples that demonstrate how to perform a task,, one can retain a small subset of examples in the\nprompt. This results in a smaller prompt and subsequently lower cost. An intriguing challenge of prompt\nselection lies in determining which examples to maintain for various queries without compromising task\nperformance.\nAn additional instantiation is query concatenation (Figure 2 (b)). It is important to note that\nprocessing queries individually necessitates sending the same prompt to an LLM API multiple times.\nTherefore,, the fundamental concept of query concatenation involves sending the prompt only once\nto the LLM API while allowing it to address multiple queries,, thereby preventing redundant prompt\nprocessing. To accomplish this,, several queries must be concatenated into a single query,, and the\nprompt must explicitly request the LLM API to process multiple queries. For instance,, to handle two\nqueries using one prompt,, the examples presented in the prompt can include both queries followed by\ntheir corresponding answers.\nStrategy 2: LLM approximation. The concept of LLM approximation is quite simple: if an LLM\nAPI is too costly to utilize,, one can approximate it using more aﬀordable models or infrastructures.\nOne example is the completion cache : as depicted in Figure 2 (c),, the fundamental idea involves storing\nthe response locally in a cache (e.g.,, a database) when submitting a query to an LLM API. To process\na new query,, we ﬁrst verify if a similar query has been previously answered. If so,, the response is\nretrieved from the cache. An LLM API is invoked only if no similar query is discovered in the cache.\nThe completion cache provides substantial cost savings when similar queries are frequently posed. For\ninstance,, consider a search engine powered by an LLM API. If numerous users search for the same or\nsimilar keywords simultaneously,, the completion cache facilitates answering all their queries by invoking\nthe LLM only once.\nAnother example of LLM approximation is model ﬁne-tuning . As shown in Figure 2(d),, this process\nconsists of three steps: ﬁrst,, collect a powerful but expensive LLM API’s responses to a few queries;\nsecond,, use the responses to ﬁne-tune a smaller and more aﬀordable AI model; and ﬁnally,, employ\nthe ﬁne-tuned model for new queries. In addition to cost savings,, the ﬁne-tuned model often does not\nrequire lengthy prompts,, thus providing latency improvements as a byproduct.\nStrategy 3: LLM cascade. The increasing availability of LLM APIs with heterogeneous performance\nand costs presents a unique opportunity for data-adaptive LLM selection. Diﬀerent LLM APIs have their\nown strengths and weaknesses for various queries. Consequently,, appropriately selecting which LLMs\nto use can provide both cost reduction and performance improvements. LLM cascade ,, as illustrated\nin Figure 2 (e),, is one such example. LLM cascade sends a query to a list of LLM APIs sequentially.\nIf one LLM API’s response is reliable,, then its response is returned,, and no further LLMs in the list\nare needed. The remaining LLM APIs are queried only if the previous APIs’ generations are deemed\ninsuﬃciently reliable. Query cost is signiﬁcantly reduced if the ﬁrst few APIs are relatively inexpensive\nand produce reliable generations.\nThe key components of LLM cascade consist of two elements: (i) a generation scoring function\nand (ii) an LLM router. The generation scoring function,, denoted by g(·,,·) :Q×A↦→ [0,,1],, generates\na reliability score given a query and an answer produced by an LLM API. The LLM router selects\nmLLM APIs to include in the list. Let LLL∈[K]mdenote the indexes of the mAPIs selected by the\nrouter. Given a new query,, it iteratively invokes the ith API in the list to obtain an answer fLi(q).\nThen,, it uses the scoring function to generate a score g(q,,fLi(q)). It returns the generation if the score\nis higher than a threshold τττi,, and queries the next service otherwise.\nThe scoring function can be obtained by training a simple regression model that learns whether\na generation is correct from the query and a generated answer. Learning the selected list LLLand the\n5\n\nthreshold vectors τττcan be modeled as a constraint optimization problem:\nmax\nLLL,,τττE[r(a,,fLz(q))]\ns.t.E[z∑\ni=1˜cLi,,2∥fLi(q)∥+ ˜cLi,,1∥q∥+ ˜cLi,,0]\n≤b,,\nz= arg min\nig(q,,fLi(q))≥τττi\nHere,,zdenotes the LLM API at which the router stops and returns the answer,, the ﬁrst constraint\nensures the average cost is bounded by the budget,, and the objective measures the quality of the\ngeneration fLz(q) for a query qcompared to the true answer a. This problem is inherently a mixed-\ninteger optimization and thus computationally expensive to solve. To address this issue,, we develop a\nspecialized optimizer that (i) prunes the search space of LLLby ignoring any list of LLMs with small\nanswer disagreement,, and (ii) approximates the objective by interpolating it within a few samples. This\nresults in an eﬃcient implementation with satisfactory performance,, as shown later in Figure 5.\nCompositions. Combining approaches within and across diﬀerent strategies can lead to further\ncost reduction and performance enhancement. For instance,, joint prompt and LLM selection is a\ncomposition of prompt selection and LLM cascade: for a given query,, it searches for the smallest prompt\nand most aﬀordable LLM that achieves satisfactory task performance. Another example is to search\nacross both existing LLM APIs and ﬁne-tuned models. It is important to note that the composition of\ndiﬀerent approaches also increases the computational costs for training. Consequently,, this paves the\nway for investigating trade-oﬀs between query costs,, task performance,, and computational costs.\n4 LLM Cascade Reduces Cost and Improves Accuracy\nIn this section,, we present an empirical study on the FrugalGPT LLM cascade. Our goals are three-fold:\n(i) understand what a simple instantiation of LLM cascade learns,, (ii) quantify the cost savings attained\nby FrugalGPT while matching the best individual LLM API’s performance,, and (iii) measure the\ntrade-oﬀs between performance and cost enabled by FrugalGPT.\nSetups: LLM APIs,, Tasks,, Datasets,, and FrugalGPT instances. We have selected 12 LLM\nAPIs from 5 mainstream providers,, namely,, OpenAI [ Ope],, AI21 [ AI2],, CoHere [ CoH],, Textsynth [ Tex],,\nand ForeFrontAI [ FFA]. The details are summarized in Table 1. FrugalGPT has been developed\non top of these APIs and evaluated on a range of datasets belonging to diﬀerent tasks,, including\nHEADLINES [ SK21 ],, OVERRULING [ ZGA+21],, and COQA [ RCM19 ]. The summary of these datasets\nis presented in Table 2. HEADLINES is a ﬁnancial news dataset whose goal is to determine the gold\nprice trend (up,, down,, neutral,, or none) by reading ﬁnancial news titles. This is especially useful for\nﬁltering relevant news in ﬁnancial markets. OVERRULING is a legal document dataset where the goal\nis to determine whether a given sentence is an overruling,, i.e.,, rejecting previous legal cases. COQA is\na reading comprehension dataset developed in a conversational setting,, which we have adapted as a\ndirect query answering task. We focus on the LLM cascade approach with a cascade length of 3,, as\nthis simpliﬁes the optimization space and already demonstrates good results. Each dataset is randomly\nsplit into a training set to learn the LLM cascade and a test set for evaluation.\nA Case Study. Let us begin with a case study on the HEADLINES dataset. We set the budget to\nbe$6.5,, which is one-ﬁfth of GPT-4’s cost. We employ a DistilBERT [ SDCW19 ] tailored to regression\nas the scoring function. It is important to note that DistilBERT is considerably smaller and therefore\nless expensive than all LLMs considered here. As depicted in Figure 3 (a),, the learned FrugalGPT\nsequentially calls GPT-J,, J1-L,, and GPT-4. For any given query,, it ﬁrst extracts an answer from\nGPT-J. If the score of this answer is greater than 0.96,, the answer is accepted as the ﬁnal response.\nOtherwise,, J1-L is queried. J1-L’s answer is accepted as the ﬁnal response if its score is greater than\n0.37; otherwise,, GPT-4 is invoked to obtain the ﬁnal answer. Interestingly,, this approach outperforms\nGPT-4 for numerous queries. For instance,, given a headline ”Gold oﬀ the lows after dismal U.S. GDP\ndata” from NASDAQ,, FrugalGPT accurately predicts that the price is going down,, while GPT-4\n6\n\nTable 1: Summary of commercial LLM APIs. We use 12 LLM APIs from 5 providers. The cost was\nretrieved in March 2023. The cost can have three additive components: input (proportional to the\nnumber of input tokens),, output (proportional to the number of generated tokens) and a ﬁxed cost per\nrequest. The LLMs’s costs can diﬀer by up to 2 orders of magnitudes. For example,, to process 10M\ninput tokens,, GPT-J from Textsynth costs only $0.2,, but OpenAI’s GPT-4 needs $30.\nProvider API Size/BCost (USD)\n10M input tokens 10M output tokens request\nOpenAIGPT-Curie 6.7 2 2 0\nChatGPT NA 2 2 0\nGPT-3 175 20 20 0\nGPT-4 NA 30 60 0\nAI21J1-Large 7.5 0 30 0.0003\nJ1-Grande 17 0 80 0.0008\nJ1-Jumbo 178 0 250 0.005\nCohere Xlarge 52 10 10 0\nForeFrontAI QA 16 5.8 5.8 0\nTextsynthGPT-J 6 0.2 5 0\nFAIRSEQ 13 0.6 15 0\nGPT-Neox 20 1.4 35 0\nTable 2: Summary of datasets used in the FrugalGPT LLM cascade experiments.\nDataset Domain Size #Examples in the prompt\nHEADLINES Finance 10000 8\nOVERRULING Law 2400 5\nCOQA Passage Reading 7982 2\nGPT-J GPT-4 J1-L score<0.96? score<0.37?\nNoNoY es Y es\nFinancial News\n(a) Learned FrugalGPT strategy  \nGPT-4\nFrugalGPT price downprice up\n(b) A query and response example  \nA s s et sApproch Accuracy Cost ($)\nGPT -4 0.857 33.1\nFrugalGPT 0.872 6.5\n(c) Overall performance and cost  \nFigure 3: A case study of FrugalGPT on the HEADLINES dataset.

One entry indicates the percent of cases that the LLM on its row is\nwrong but the LLM on its column gives the right answer. Overall,, we observe that cheap LLMs can\nbe complementary to the expensive ones quite often. For example,, for about 6% of the data,, GPT-4\nmakes a mistake but GPJ-J (or J-L or GPT-C) gives the right answer on HEADLINES.\nprovides an incorrect answer (as shown in Figure 3(b)). Overall,, FrugalGPT results in both accuracy\ngains and cost reduction. As illustrated in Figure 3(c),, its cost is reduced by 80%,, while the accuracy\nis even 1.5% higher.\nLLM diversity. Why can multiple LLM APIs potentially produce better performance than the\nbest individual LLM? In essence,, this is due to generation diversity: even an inexpensive LLM can\nsometimes correctly answer queries on which a more expensive LLM fails. To measure this diversity,,\nwe use the maximum performance improvement,, or MPI. The MPI of LLM A with respect to LLM B\nis the probability that LLM A generates the correct answer while LLM B provides incorrect ones. This\nmetric essentially measures the maximum performance gains achievable by invoking LLM A in addition\nto LLM B.\nMPI between each pair of LLM APIs for all datasets is displayed in Figure 4. Overall,, we observe\nsigniﬁcant potential within the LLM marketplace. For instance,, GPT-C,, GPT-J,, and J1-L can all\nenhance GPT-4’s performance by up to 6% on the HEADLINES dataset. On the COQA dataset,, there\nare 13% of data points where GPT-4 makes an error,, but GPT-3 provides the correct answer. Although\nthese improvement upper bounds may not always be attainable,, they do demonstrate the possibility of\nutilizing more aﬀordable services to achieve better performance.\nTable 3: Cost savings by FrugalGPT to match the best individual LLM’s performance.\nDataset Best invidual LLMCost to reach the same accuracy\nCost SavingsBest individual LLM FrugalGPT\nHEADLINES GPT-4 33.1 0.6 98.3%\nOVERULLING GPT-4 9.7 2.6 73.3%\nCOQA GPT-3 72.5 29.6 59.2%\nCost Savings. Subsequently,, we examine whether FrugalGPT can reduce costs while maintaining\naccuracy and,, if so,, by how much. Table 3 displays the overall cost savings of FrugalGPT,, which range\nfrom 50% to 98%. This is feasible because FrugalGPT identiﬁes the queries that can be accurately\nanswered by smaller LLMs and,, as a result,, only invokes those cost-eﬀective LLMs. Powerful but\nexpensive LLMs,, such as GPT-4,, are utilized only for challenging queries detected by FrugalGPT.\nPerformance and Cost Trade-oﬀs. Now,, we investigate the trade-oﬀs between performance and\ncost achieved by FrugalGPT,, as illustrated in Figure 5. Several interesting observations can be made.\n8\n\nFrugalGPT\nKinross Gold\nupgraded to\noutperformer from\nneutral at CIBCFrugalGPT\n0.17 < 0.96GPT-J GPT-4 J1-L\nUp Up None0.13 < 0.37None\nGPT-4 NoneGold holds ground\nat 1-month low on\nhawkish Fed\ncomments0.16 < 0.96GPT-J J1-L\nUp Down\nneutralDownGold off the lows\nafter dismal U.S.\nGDPFrugalGPT\n0.97>0.96 GPT-J\nDownDown\nGPT-4 Up\n0.44>0.37\nGPT-4\nGPT-Neo\nFSQGPT-J   J1\nJ1-G\nJ1-L CoHere\nFQGPT-3\nChatGPT\nGPT-CGPT-4\n0 10 20 30 400.70.720.740.760.780.80.820.840.860.88 FrugalGPT\nCost ($)Accuracy\nFrugalGPT\n[...] results from\ndenying an\navailable and\naccommodation.

Overall,, FrugalGPT often achieves the\nsame performance of the best individual LLM API (e.g.,, GPT-4) with orders of magnitudes smaller\ncost. When incurring the same cost,, FrugalGPT can improves the accuracy by up to 5%. Examples of\nLLM cascade for each dataset are shown on the right.\n9\n\nFirst,, the cost ranking of diﬀerent LLM APIs is not ﬁxed. For instance,, J1 is the second most expensive\nLLM on the HEADLINES dataset,, while GPT-3 holds that position on the OVERRULING and COQA\ndatasets. This is primarily due to the heterogeneous pricing mechanism: J1 incurs a high cost for\neach generated token but charges nothing for input tokens,, whereas GPT-3 charges for both input and\noutput tokens. Moreover,, more expensive LLM APIs sometimes result in worse performance than their\ncheaper counterparts. For example,, J1 is costlier than GPT-3 on HEADLINES,, but its performance\nis inferior. These observations underscore the importance of aptly selecting LLM APIs,, even in the\nabsence of budget constraints.\nNext,, we note that FrugalGPT enables smooth performance-cost trade-oﬀs across all evaluated\ndatasets. This oﬀers ﬂexible choices to LLM users and potentially helps LLM API providers save\nenergy and reduce carbon emissions. In fact,, FrugalGPT can simultaneously reduce costs and improve\naccuracy. For example,, on the OVERRULING dataset,, FrugalGPT achieves a 1% accuracy gain while\nreducing costs by 73% compared to the best LLM API,, GPT-4. This is likely because FrugalGPT\nintegrates knowledge from multiple LLMs.\nThe example queries shown in Figure 5 further aid in understanding why FrugalGPT can simul-\ntaneously improve performance and reduce costs. GPT-4 makes mistakes on some queries (e.g.,, the\nﬁrst example in part (a)),, but some low-cost APIs provide correct predictions. FrugalGPT accurately\nidentiﬁes those queries and relies solely on the inexpensive APIs. For example,, GPT-4 incorrectly infers\nno overruling from the legal statement ”The time has come to reconcile and regularize our cases in\nthis ﬁeld,,” as shown in Figure 5(b). However,, FrugalGPT accepts GPT-J’s correct answer,, avoiding\nthe use of expensive LLMs and improving overall performance. Naturally,, a single LLM API is not\nalways correct; LLM cascade overcomes this by employing a chain of LLM APIs. For example,, in\nthe second example shown in Figure 5(a),, FrugalGPT identiﬁes that GPT-J’s generation may not be\nreliable and turns to the second LLM in the chain,, J1-L,, to ﬁnd the correct answer. Again,, GPT-4\nprovides the wrong answer. FrugalGPT is not perfect,, and there remains ample room for cost reduction.\nFor example,, in the third example in Figure 5(c),, all LLM APIs in the chain give the same answer.\nHowever,, FrugalGPT is unsure if the ﬁrst LLMs are correct,, resulting in the need to query all LLMs in\nthe chain. Identifying how to avoid such cases remains an open problem.\n5 Discussions,, Limitations and Future Prospects\nThe substantial cost of employing LLMs in real-world scenarios presents a considerable barrier to their\nwidespread usage. In this paper,, we outline and discuss practical strategies for reducing the inference\ncost of using LLM APIs. We also developed FrugalGPT to illustrate one of the cost-saving strategies,,\nLLM cascade. Our empirical ﬁndings show that FrugalGPT can reduce costs by up to 98% while\npreserving the performance of cutting-edge LLMs.\nFrugalGPT lays the groundwork for optimizing task performance with LLM APIs under budget\nconstraints; however,, it has some limitations. To train the LLM cascade strategy in FrugalGPT,, we\nneed some labeled examples. And in order for the cascade to work well,, the training examples should be\nfrom the same or similar distribution as the test examples. Moreover,, learning the LLM cascade itself\nrequires resources. We view this as an one-time upfront cost; this is beneﬁcial when the ﬁnal query\ndataset is larger than the data used to train the cascade. There are also other promising strategies\nfor cost saving,, such as speeding up attention computation itself,, that we do not discuss here. Given\nthe rapid development of LLM,, this paper is not meant to be comprehensive or to provide a deﬁnitive\nsolution. Our goal is to lay a foundation for this important research agenda and to demonstrate that\neven simple cascade can already achieve promising savings.\nThere are also many related directions for future exploration. While FrugalGPT concentrates\non balancing performance and cost,, real-world applications call for the evaluation of other critical\nfactors,, including latency,, fairness,, privacy,, and environmental impact. Incorporating these elements\ninto optimization methodologies while maintaining performance and cost-eﬀectiveness is an important\navenue for future research. Furthermore,, utilizing LLMs in risk-critical applications necessitates the\ncareful quantiﬁcation of uncertainty in LLM-generated outputs. As the ﬁeld progresses,, addressing the\nenvironmental ramiﬁcations of training and deploying LLMs demands a joint eﬀort from LLM users\nand API providers. The continuous evolution of LLMs and their applications will inevitably unveil new\nchallenges and opportunities,, fostering further research and development in this dynamic ﬁeld.\n10\n\nReferences\n[AI2] AI21 LLM API. https://www.ai21.com/ .

This\nnaturally led to an intense focus on models as the primary ingredient in AI application\ndevelopment,, with everyone wondering what capabilities new LLMs will bring. As more\ndevelopers begin to build using LLMs,, however,, we believe that this focus is rapidly changing:\nstate-of-the-art AI results are increasingly obtained by compound systems with multiple\ncomponents,, not just monolithic models.\nFor example,, Google’s AlphaCode 2 set state-of-the-art results in programming through a\ncarefully engineered system that uses LLMs to generate up to 1 million possible solutions for a\ntask and then \x00lter down the set. AlphaGeometry,, likewise,, combines an LLM with a traditional\nsymbolic solver to tackle olympiad problems. In enterprises,, our colleagues at Databricks found\nthat 60% of LLM applications use some form of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),, and\n30% use multi-step chains. Even researchers working on traditional language model tasks,, who\nused to report results from a single LLM call,, are now reporting results from increasingly\ncomplex inference strategies: Microsoft wrote about a chaining strategy that exceeded GPT-4’s\naccuracy on medical exams by 9%,, and Google’s Gemini launch post measured its MMLU\nbenchmark results using a new CoT@32 inference strategy that calls the model 32 times,, which\nraised questions about its comparison to just a single call to GPT-4. This shift to compound\nsystems opens many interesting design questions,, but it is also exciting,, because it means\nleading AI results can be achieved through clever engineering,, not just scaling up training.\nIn this post,, we analyze the trend toward compound AI systems and what it means for AI\ndevelopers. Why are developers building compound systems? Is this paradigm here to stay as\nmodels improve? And what are the emerging tools for developing and optimizing such systems\n—an area that has received far less research than model training? We argue that compound AI\nsystems will likely be the best way to maximize AI results in the future,, and might be one of\nthe most impactful trends in AI in 2024.\n\n3/5/24,, 8:22 AM The Shift from Models to Compound AI Systems – The Berkeley Artiﬁcial Intelligence Research Blog\nhttps://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2024/02/18/compound-ai-systems/ 2/6\nIncreasingly m any new AI results are from  com pound system s.\nWhy Use Compound AI Systems?\nWe de\x00ne a Compound AI System as a system that tackles AI tasks using multiple interacting\ncomponents,, including multiple calls to models,, retrievers,, or external tools. In contrast,, an AI\nModel is simply a statistical model,, e.g.,, a Transformer that predicts the next token in text.\nEven though AI models are continually getting better,, and there is no clear end in sight to their\nscaling,, more and more state-of-the-art results are obtained using compound systems. Why is\nthat? We have seen several distinct reasons:\n1. Some tasks are easier to improve via system design. While LLMs appear to follow\nremarkable scaling laws that predictably yield better results with more compute,, in many\napplications,, scaling o\x00ers lower returns-vs-cost than building a compound system. For\nexample,, suppose that the current best LLM can solve coding contest problems 30% of the\ntime,, and tripling its training budget would increase this to 35%; this is still not reliable\nenough to win a coding contest! In contrast,, engineering a system that samples from the\nmodel multiple times,, tests each sample,, etc. might increase performance to 80% with\ntoday’s models,, as shown in work like AlphaCode. Even more importantly,, iterating on a\nsystem design is often much faster than waiting for training runs. We believe that in any\nhigh-value application,, developers will want to use every tool available to maximize AI\nquality,, so they will use system ideas in addition to scaling. We frequently see this with\nLLM users,, where a good LLM creates a compelling but frustratingly unreliable \x00rst demo,,\nand engineering teams then go on to systematically raise quality.\n2. Systems can be dynamic. Machine learning models are inherently limited because they are\ntrained on static datasets,, so their “knowledge” is \x00xed. Therefore,, developers need to\ncombine models with other components,, such as search and retrieval,, to incorporate\ntimely data. In addition,, training lets a model “see” the whole training set,, so more\ncomplex systems are needed to build AI applications with access controls (e.g.,, answer a\nuser’s questions based only on \x00les the user has access to).\n3. Improving control and trust is easier with systems. Neural network models alone are\nhard to control: while training will in\x00uence them,, it is nearly impossible to guarantee that\na model will avoid certain behaviors. Using an AI system instead of a model can help\ndevelopers control behavior more tightly,, e.g.,, by \x00ltering model outputs. Likewise,, even\nthe best LLMs still hallucinate,, but a system combining,, say,, LLMs with retrieval can\nincrease user trust by providing citations or automatically verifying facts.\n4. Performance goals vary widely. Each AI model has a \x00xed quality level and cost,, but\napplications often need to vary these parameters. In some applications,, such as inline code\nsuggestions,, the best AI models are too expensive,, so tools like Github Copilot use carefully\ntuned smaller models and various search heuristics to provide results. In other\napplications,, even the largest models,, like GPT-4,, are too cheap! Many users would be\nwilling to pay a few dollars for a correct legal opinion,, instead of the few cents it takes to\nask GPT-4,, but a developer would need to design an AI system to utilize this larger budget.\nThe shift to compound systems in Generative AI also matches the industry trends in other AI\n\x00elds,, such as self-driving cars: most of the state-of-the-art implementations are systems\nwith multiple specialized components (more discussion here). For these reasons,, we believe\ncompound AI systems will remain a leading paradigm even as models improve.\nDeveloping Compound AI Systems\nWhile compound AI systems can o\x00er clear bene\x00ts,, the art of designing,, optimizing,, and\noperating them is still emerging. On the surface,, an AI system is a combination of traditional\n\n3/5/24,, 8:22 AM The Shift from Models to Compound AI Systems – The Berkeley Artiﬁcial Intelligence Research Blog\nhttps://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2024/02/18/compound-ai-systems/ 3/6software and AI models,, but there are many interesting design questions. For example,, should\nthe overall “control logic” be written in traditional code (e.g.,, Python code that calls an LLM),,\nor should it be driven by an AI model (e.g. LLM agents that call external tools)? Likewise,, in a\ncompound system,, where should a developer invest resources—for example,, in a RAG pipeline,,\nis it better to spend more FLOPS on the retriever or the LLM,, or even to call an LLM multiple\ntimes? Finally,, how can we optimize an AI system with discrete components end-to-end to\nmaximize a metric,, the same way we can train a neural network? In this section,, we detail a few\nexample AI systems,, then discuss these challenges and recent research on them.\nThe AI System Design Space\nBelow are few recent compound AI systems to show the breadth of design choices:\nAI System Components Design Results\nAlphaCode 2 Fine-tuned LLMs for\nsampling and scoring\nprograms\nCode execution module\nClustering modelGenerates up to 1\nmillion solutions for a\ncoding problem then\n\x00lters and scores themMatches 85th\npercentile of\nhumans on co\ncontests\nAlphaGeometry Fine-tuned LLM\nSymbolic math engineIteratively suggests\nconstructions in a\ngeometry problem via\nLLM and checks\ndeduced facts\nproduced by symbolic\nengineBetween silve\ngold Internati\nMath Olympia\nmedalists on t\ntest\nMedprompt GPT-4 LLM\nNearest-neighbor search\nin database of correct\nexamples\nLLM-generated chain-\nof-thought examples\nMultiple samples and\nensemblingAnswers medical\nquestions by searching\nfor similar examples\nto construct a few-\nshot prompt,, adding\nmodel-generated\nchain-of-thought for\neach example,, and\ngenerating and\njudging up to 11\nsolutionsOutperforms\nspecialized\nmedical mode\nlike Med-PaLM\nused with sim\nprompting\nstrategies\nGemini on\nMMLUGemini LLM\nCustom inference logicGemini's CoT@32\ninference strategy for\nthe MMLU benchmark\nsamples 32 chain-of-\nthought answers from\nthe model,, and returns\nthe top choice if\nenough of them agree,,\nor uses generation\nwithout chain-of-\nthought if not90.04% on MM\ncompared to\n86.4% for GPT\nwith 5-shot\nprompting or\n83.7% for Gem\nwith 5-shot\nprompting\nChatGPT Plus LLM\nWeb Browser plugin for\nretrieving timely contentThe ChatGPT Plus\no\x00ering can call tools\nsuch as web browsingPopular consu\nAI product wit\n\n3/5/24,, 8:22 AM The Shift from Models to Compound AI Systems – The Berkeley Artiﬁcial Intelligence Research Blog\nhttps://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2024/02/18/compound-ai-systems/ 4/6Code Interpreter plugin\nfor executing Python\nDALL-E image generatorto answer questions;\nthe LLM determines\nwhen and how to call\neach tool as it\nrespondsmillions of pa\nsubscribers\nRAG,, ORQA,,\nBing,, Baleen,,\netcLLM (sometimes called\nmultiple times)\nRetrieval systemCombine LLMs with\nretrieval systems in\nvarious ways,, e.g.,,\nasking an LLM to\ngenerate a search\nquery,, or directly\nsearching for the\ncurrent contextWidely used\ntechnique in\nsearch engine\nenterprise app\nKey Challenges in Compound AI Systems\nCompound AI systems pose new challenges in design,, optimization and operation compared to\nAI models.\nDesign Space\nThe range of possible system designs for a given task is vast. For example,, even in the simple\ncase of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with a retriever and language model,, there are:\n(i) many retrieval and language models to choose from,, (ii) other techniques to improve\nretrieval quality,, such as query expansion or reranking models,, and (iii) techniques to improve\nthe LLM’s generated output (e.g.,, running another LLM to check that the output relates to the\nretrieved passages). Developers have to explore this vast space to \x00nd a good design.\nIn addition,, developers need to allocate limited resources,, like latency and cost budgets,, among\nthe system components. For example,, if you want to answer RAG questions in 100 milliseconds,,\nshould you budget to spend 20 ms on the retriever and 80 on the LLM,, or the other way around?\nOptimization\nOften in ML,, maximizing the quality of a compound system requires co-optimizing the\ncomponents to work well together. For example,, consider a simple RAG application where an\nLLM sees a user question,, generates a search query to send to a retriever,, and then generates an\nanswer. Ideally,, the LLM would be tuned to generate queries that work well for that particular\nretriever,, and the retriever would be tuned to prefer answers that work well for that LLM.\nIn single model development a la PyTorch,, users can easily optimize a model end-to-end\nbecause the whole model is di\x00erentiable. However,, compound AI systems contain non-\ndi\x00erentiable components like search engines or code interpreters,, and thus require new\nmethods of optimization. Optimizing these compound AI systems is still a new research area;\nfor example,, DSPy o\x00ers a general optimizer for pipelines of pretrained LLMs and other\ncomponents,, while others systems,, like LaMDA,, Toolformer and AlphaGeometry,, use tool calls\nduring model training to optimize models for those tools.\nOperation\nMachine learning operations (MLOps) become more challenging for compound AI systems. For\nexample,, while it is easy to track success rates for a traditional ML model like a spam classi\x00er,,\nhow should developers track and debug the performance of an LLM agent for the same task,,\nwhich might use a variable number of “re\x00ection” steps or external API calls to classify a\nmessage? We believe that a new generation of MLOps tools will be developed to tackle these\nproblems. Interesting problems include:\nMonitoring: How can developers most e\x00ciently log,, analyze,, and debug traces from\ncomplex AI systems?\n\n3/5/24,, 8:22 AM The Shift from Models to Compound AI Systems – The Berkeley Artiﬁcial Intelligence Research Blog\nhttps://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2024/02/18/compound-ai-systems/ 5/6DataOps: Because many AI systems involve data serving components like vector DBs,, and\ntheir behavior depends on the quality of data served,, any focus on operations for these\nsystems should additionally span data pipelines.\nSecurity: Research has shown that compound AI systems,, such as an LLM chatbot with a\ncontent \x00lter,, can create unforeseen security risks compared to individual models. New\ntools will be required to secure these systems.\nEmerging Paradigms\nTo tackle the challenges of building compound AI systems,, multiple new approaches are arising\nin the industry and in research. We highlight a few of the most widely used ones and examples\nfrom our research on tackling these challenges.\nDesigning AI Systems: Composition Frameworks and Strategies. Many developers are now\nusing “language model programming” frameworks that let them build applications out of\nmultiple calls to AI models and other components. These include component libraries like\nLangChain and LlamaIndex that developers call from traditional programs,, agent frameworks\nlike AutoGPT and BabyAGI that let an LLM drive the application,, and tools for controlling LM\noutputs,, like Guardrails,, Outlines,, LMQL and SGLang. In parallel,, researchers are developing\nnumerous new inference strategies to generate better outputs using calls to models and tools,,\nsuch as chain-of-thought,, self-consistency,, WikiChat,, RAG and others.\nAutomatically Optimizing Quality: DSPy. Coming from academia,, DSPy is the \x00rst framework\nthat aims to optimize a system composed of LLM calls and other tools to maximize a target\nmetric. Users write an application out of calls to LLMs and other tools,, and provide a target\nmetric such as accuracy on a validation set,, and then DSPy automatically tunes the pipeline by\ncreating prompt instructions,, few-shot examples,, and other parameter choices for each\nmodule to maximize end-to-end performance. The e\x00ect is similar to end-to-end\noptimization of a multi-layer neural network in PyTorch,, except that the modules in DSPy are\nnot always di\x00erentiable layers. To do that,, DSPy leverages the linguistic abilities of LLMs in a\nclean way: to specify each module,, users write a natural language signature,, such as\nuser_question -> search_query,, where the names of the input and output \x00elds are\nmeaningful,, and DSPy automatically turns this into suitable prompts with instructions,, few-\nshot examples,, or even weight updates to the underlying language models.\nOptimizing Cost: FrugalGPT and AI Gateways. The wide range of AI models and services\navailable makes it challenging to pick the right one for an application. Moreover,, di\x00erent\nmodels may perform better on di\x00erent inputs. FrugalGPT is a framework to automatically\nroute inputs to di\x00erent AI model cascades to maximize quality subject to a target budget.\nBased on a small set of examples,, it learns a routing strategy that can outperform the best LLM\nservices by up to 4% at the same cost,, or reduce cost by up to 90% while matching their quality.\nFrugalGPT is an example of a broader emerging concept of AI gateways or routers,,\nimplemented in software like Databricks AI Gateway,, OpenRouter,, and Martian,, to optimize the\nperformance of each component of an AI application. These systems work even better when an\nAI task is broken into smaller modular steps in a compound system,, and the gateway can\noptimize routing separately for each step.\nOperation: LLMOps and DataOps. AI applications have always required careful monitoring of\nboth model outputs and data pipelines to run reliably. With compound AI systems,, however,, the\nbehavior of the system on each input can be considerably more complex,, so it is important to\ntrack all the steps taken by the application and intermediate outputs. Software like LangSmith,,\nPhoenix Traces,, and Databricks Inference Tables can track,, visualize and evaluate these outputs\nat a \x00ne granularity,, in some cases also correlating them with data pipeline quality and\ndownstream metrics. In the research world,, DSPy Assertions seeks to leverage feedback from\nmonitoring checks directly in AI systems to improve outputs,, and AI-based quality evaluation\nmethods like MT-Bench,, FAVA and ARES aim to automate quality monitoring.\nConclusion\n\n3/5/24,, 8:22 AM The Shift from Models to Compound AI Systems – The Berkeley Artiﬁcial Intelligence Research Blog\nhttps://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2024/02/18/compound-ai-systems/ 6/6Generative AI has excited every developer by unlocking a wide range of capabilities through\nnatural language prompting. As developers aim to move beyond demos and maximize the\nquality of their AI applications,, however,, they are increasingly turning to compound AI systems\nas a natural way to control and enhance the capabilities of LLMs. Figuring out the best practices\nfor developing compound AI systems is still an open question,, but there are already exciting\napproaches to aid with design,, end-to-end optimization,, and operation. We believe that\ncompound AI systems will remain the best way to maximize the quality and reliability of AI\napplications going forward,, and may be one of the most important trends in AI in 2024.\nBibTex for this post:\n@misc{compound-ai-blog,,\n  title={The Shift from Models to Compound AI Systems},,\n  author={Matei Zaharia and Omar Khattab and Lingjiao Chen and Jared\n          and Heather Miller and Chris Potts and James Zou and Micha\n          and Jonathan Frankle and Naveen Rao and Ali Ghodsi},,\n  howpublished={\\url{https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2024/02/18/compo\n  year={2024}\n}\nSubscribe to our RSS feed.\nSpread the word: \uf09a \uf099 \uf0d5 \uf0e1 \uf1a1 \uf1d4\n\n"",, 'status': 'SUCCESS'}"
