Abstract
GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are the two most widely used large language model (LLM) services.
However,, when and how these models are updated over time is opaque. Here,, we evaluate the
March 2023 and June 2023 versions of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on several diverse tasks: 1) math
problems,, 2) sensitive/dangerous questions,, 3) opinion surveys,, 4) multi-hop knowledge-intensive
questions,, 5) generating code,, 6) US Medical License tests,, and 7) visual reasoning. We find
that the performance and behavior of both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can vary greatly over time. For
example,, GPT-4 (March 2023) was reasonable at identifying prime vs. composite numbers (84%
accuracy) but GPT-4 (June 2023) was poor on these same questions (51% accuracy). This is
partly explained by a drop in GPT-4’s amenity to follow chain-of-thought prompting. Interestingly,,
GPT-3.5 was much better in June than in March in this task. GPT-4 became less willing to
answer sensitive questions and opinion survey questions in June than in March. GPT-4 performed
better at multi-hop questions in June than in March,, while GPT-3.5’s performance dropped on
this task. Both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 had more formatting mistakes in code generation in June
than in March. We provide evidence that GPT-4’s ability to follow user instructions has decreased
over time,, which is one common factor behind the many behavior drifts. Overall,, our findings show
that the behavior of the “same” LLM service can change substantially in a relatively short amount
of time,, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring of LLMs.
1 Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are being widely used. A LLM like GPT-4
can be updated over time based on data and feedback from users as well as design changes. However,,
it is currently opaque when and how GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are updated,, and it is unclear how each
update affects the behavior of these LLMs. These unknowns makes it challenging to stably integrate
LLMs into larger workflows: if LLM’s response to a prompt (e.g. its accuracy or formatting) suddenly
changes,, this might break the downstream pipeline. It also makes it challenging,, if not impossible,, to
reproduce results from the “same” LLM.
Beyond these integration challenges,, it is also an interesting question whether an LLM service like
GPT-4 is consistently improving over time. It is important to know whether updates to the model
aimed at improving some aspects can reduce its capability in other dimensions.
Motivated by these questions,, we evaluated the behavior of the March 2023 and June 2023 versions
of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on several tasks: 1) solving math problems,, 2) answering sensitive/dangerous
questions,, 3) answering opinion surveys,, 4) answering multi-hop knowledge-intensive questions,, 5)
generating code,, 6) US Medical License exams,, and 7) visual reasoning. These tasks were selected to
evaluate diverse and useful capabilities of these LLMs. We find that the performance and behavior of
both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 varied significantly across these two releases and that their performance on
some tasks have gotten substantially worse over time,, while they have improved on other problems
(summarized in Figure 1).
How to explain those performance and behavior drifts? We hypothesize that changes in ChatGPT’s
ability to follow user instructions could be a common factor behind the drifts across tasks. As a first
step towards testing this hypothesis,, we have curated a set of task-agnostic instructions,, and evaluate
the March and June versions of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 on it. Overall,, we observe a large decrease of
GPT-4’s ability to follow many instructions. GPT-4 in March was typically good at following user’s
instructions (e.g. generating responses following specified formats),, but in June it failed to follow most
of these simple instructions (Figure 1).

and GPT-3.5 (right panel) between March 2023 and June 2023. Higher evaluation metric is better.
On eight diverse tasks (detailed below),, the models’ performance drifts considerably over time,, and
sometimes for the worse. The decrease of GPT-4’s ability to follow instructions over time matched its
behavior drift and partially explained the corresponding performance drops.
Our findings highlight the need to continuously monitor LLMs’ behavior over time. All prompts we
curated in this paper and responses from GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 in both March and June are collected
and released in https://github.com/lchen001/LLMDrift . Our analysis and visualization code has
also been open-sourced. We hope our work stimulates more study on LLM drifts to enable trustworthy
and reliable LLM applications.
Related Work. There have been multiple benchmarks and evaluations of LLMs including GPT-3.5
and GPT-4 [ LBL+22,,ZPM+23,,LNT+23,,BCL+23]. Existing works show that LLMs achieve reasonable
performance on traditional language tasks such as reading comprehension [ dW23 ],, translation [ JWH+23],,
and summarization [ GLD22 ]. More recently,, GPT-4 was shown to successfully pass difficult exams in
professional domains such as medicine [ NKM+23] and law [ KBGA23 ]. To the best of our knowledge,,
most of these works do not systematically monitor the longitudinal drifts of widely used LLM services
over time or report large drifts in them. ChatLog [ TLY+23] proposed recording and monitoring
ChatGPT’s responses automatically over time and reported small shifts (most below 5%) in ChatGPT’s
performance on some common benchmarks. Other papers [ AAKA23 ,,SKNM23 ] also reported shifts
in specific problems. Monitoring model performance shifts is an emerging research area for machine-
learning-as-a-service (MLaaS) more broadly. [ CJE+22] offers a large-scale longitudinal dataset of
commercial ML service responses on various evaluation tasks,, and [ CCZZ21 ] studies how to efficiently
estimate ML service performance shifts. Those papers focus on ML services for simple classification
tasks such as sentiment analysis,, while this work studies generative LLM services.

2 Overview: LLM Services,, Tasks and Metrics
This paper studies how different LLMs’ behaviors change over time. To answer it quantitatively,, we
need to specify (i) which LLM services to monitor,, (ii) on which application scenarios to focus,, and (iii)
how to measure LLM drifts in each scenario.
LLM Services. The LLM services monitored in this paper are GPT-4 and GPT-3.5,, which form the
backbone of ChatGPT. Due to the popularity of ChatGPT,, both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 have been widely
adopted by individual users and a number of businesses. Thus,, timely and systematically monitoring
these two services helps a large range of users better understand and leverage LLMs for their own use
cases. At the time of writing,, there are two major versions available for GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 through
OpenAI’s API,, one snapshotted in March 2023 and another in June 2023. Therefore we focus on the
drifts between these two dates. For simplicity,, we queried these services via the user prompt only and
left the system prompt as default. We set the temperature to be 0.1 to reduce output randomness,, as
creativity was not needed in our evaluation tasks.

safety benchmarks: solving math problems (including two problem types),, answering sensitive questions ,,
answering OpinionQA survey ,,LangChain HotpotQA Agent ,,code generation ,,taking USMLE medical
exam ,, and visual reasoning ,, as shown in Figure 1. These tasks are selected for two reasons. First,, they
are diverse tasks frequently used to evaluate LLMs in the literature [ WWS+22,,ZPM+23,,CTJ+21].
Second,, they are relatively objective and thus easy-to-evaluate . For each task,, we use queries either
sampled from existing datasets or constructed by us. We acknowledge that the specific benchmark
datasets used here does not comprehensively cover the complex behaviors of ChatGPT. Our goal here
is not to provide a holistic assessment but to demonstrate that substantial ChatGPT performance drift
exists on simple tasks. We are adding more benchmarks in future evaluations as part of a broader,,
long-term study of LLM service behavior. We cover each task in detail in the next section.
Metrics. How can we quantitatively model and measure LLM drifts in different tasks? Here,, we
consider one main performance metric for each task and two common additional metrics for all tasks.
The former captures the performance measurement specific to each scenario,, while the latter covers
common complementary measurement across different applications.
In particular,, we use accuracy (how often an LLM service generates the correct answer) as our main
metric for math problems and USMLE questions. For answering sensitive and opinion questions,, we
use the response rate ,, i.e. the frequency that an LLM service directly answers a question. For code
generation,, the main metric is what fraction of the outputs are directly executable (if the code can be
directly executed in a programming environment and pass the unit tests). For visual reasoning and
LangChain,, it is exact match (whether the final response exactly matches the ground truth).
Our first common additional metric is verbosity ,, i.e.,, the length of generation measured in the
number of characters. The second one is mismatch ,, i.e. how often,, for the same prompt,, the extracted
answers by two versions of the same LLM service do not match. Note that this only compares the
answers’ differences,, not the raw generations. For example,, for math problems,, mismatch is 0 if the
generated answers are the same,, even if the intermediate reasoning steps are different. For each LLM
service,, we use the mismatch’s empirical mean over the entire population to quantify how much an
LLM service’s desired functionality,, instead of the textual outputs,, deviates over time. Larger mismatch
means greater drifts. For each of the other metrics,, We compute its population mean for both the
March and June versions,, and leverage their differences to measure the drift sizes.
3 Monitoring Reveals Substantial LLM Drifts
3.1 Math I (Prime vs Composite): Chain-of-Thought Can Fail
How do GPT-4 and GPT-3.5’s math solving skills evolve over time? As a canonical study,, we explore
the drifts in these LLMs’ ability to figure out whether a given integer is prime or composite. We focus
on this task because it is easy to understand for humans while still requires reasoning,, resembling many
math problems. The dataset contains 1,,000 questions,, where 500 primes were extracted from [ ZPM+23]
and 500 composite numbers were sampled uniformly from all composite numbers within the interval
[1,,000,, 20,,000]. To help the LLMs reason,, we use Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting [ WWS+22],, a
standard approach for reasoning-heavy tasks.
Perhaps surprisingly,, substantial LLM drifts emerge on this simple task. As shown in Figure 3(a),,
GPT-4’s accuracy dropped from 84.0% in March to 51.1% in June,, and there was a large improvement of
GPT-3.5’s accuracy,, from 49.6% to 76.2%. In addition,, GPT-4’s response became much more compact:
its average verbosity (number of generated characters) decreased from 638.3 in March to 3.9 in June.
On the other hand,, there was about 22.2% growth in GPT-3.5’s response length. The answer mismatch
between their March and June versions was also large for both services.
Why was there such a large difference? One possible explanation is change in the chain-of-thought
(CoT) behaviors. Figure 3 (b) gives an illustrative example. To determine whether 17077 is a prime
number,, the GPT-4’s March version followed the CoT instruction well. It first decomposed the task
into four steps,, checking if 17077 is even,, finding 17077’s square root,, obtaining all prime numbers
less than it,, checking if 17077 is divisible by any of these numbers. Then it executed each step,, and
finally reached the correct answer that 17077 is indeed a prime number. However,, the chain-of-thought
did not work for the June version: the service did not generate any intermediate steps,, even though

is odd,, so we proceed to the next step. Step 2: Find the square root of the number .
The square root of 17077 is approximately 130.68. Step 3: Check if the number is
divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root. The prime

4: Test each of these prime numbers as a divisor . If any of them divide 17077 without

listed above without a remainder . Therefore,, 17077 is a prime number . Answer: [Y es]
[No] [No] Explanation: T o determine if 17077 is a prime number ,, we need to check if it is
only divisible by 1 and itself. W e can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. If it is,,
then it is not a prime number . 17077 is an odd number ,, so it is not divisible by 2.
Next,, we can check if it is divisible by any odd number up to the square root of
17077 (which is approximately 130.7). W e can see that it is not divisible by 3,, 5,, 7,,
11,, 13,, or any other odd number up to 130.7. Therefore,, 17077 is a prime number .
To determine if 17077 is a prime number ,, we need to check if it is divisible by any
number other than 1 and itself. 1. W e start by checking if 17077 is divisible by 2.
Since it is an odd number (not divisible by 2),, we move on to the next step. 2. Next,,
we check if 17077 is divisible by 3. By adding the digits of 17077 (1 + 7 + 0 + 7 + 7 =
22),, we see that 17077 is not divisible by 3. 3. W e continue by checking if 17077 is
divisible by 5. Since it does not end in 0 or 5,, it is not divisible by 5. 4. Next,, we
check if 17077 is divisible by 7. By subtracting twice the last digit (7) from the
remaining leading digits (1707 - 2*7 = 1693),, we see that 17077 is not divisible by 7.
5. We continue by checking if 17077 is divisible by 1 1. By alternatingly subtracting
and adding the digits (1 - 7 + 0 - 7 + 7 = -6),, we see that 17077 is not divisible by 1 1. 
6. Finally ,, we check if 17077 is divisible by 13. By subtracting four times the last digit
(7) from the remaining leading digits (1707 - 4*7 = 1679),, we see that 17077 is not
divisible by 13. Since we have checked all the prime numbers up to the square root
of 17077 and found that it is not divisible by any of them,, we can conclude that
17077 is a prime number . [Yes]Accuracy Verbosity Accuracy Verbosity Mismatcha

EvaluationFigure 3: Math I (prime vs composite). (a): monitored accuracy,, verbosity (unit: character),, and
answer mismatch of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 between March and June 2023. Overall,, a large performance
drifts existed for both services. (b) An example query and corresponding responses over time. GPT-4
followed the chain-of-thought instruction to obtain the right answer in March,, but ignored it in June
with the wrong answer. GPT-3.5 always followed the chain-of-thought,, but it insisted on generating a
wrong answer ( [No]) first in March. This issue was largely fixed in June.
the prompt asked to think step-by-step,, and simply produced “No”. Chain-of-thought’s effects had a
different drift pattern for GPT-3.5. In March,, GPT-3.5 inclined to generate the answer “No” first and
then performed the reasoning steps. Thus,, even if the steps and final conclusion (“17077 is a prime
number”) were correct,, its nominal answer was still wrong. On the other hand,, the June update seemed
to fix this issue: it started by writing the reasoning steps and finally generate the answer “Yes”,, which
was correct. This interesting phenomenon indicates that the same prompting approach,, even the widely
adopted chain-of-thought strategy,, could lead to substantially different performances due to LLM drifts.
To further investigate the impact of CoT behavior changes,, we compared the responses of GPT-4
and GPT-3.5 on the same questions with and without explicit CoT instructions. For the latter,, we
simply ask the model to give a binary generation without explicitly asking it to think step-by-step (e.g.,,
Is 17077 a prime number? Answer ”[Yes]” or ”[No]”.).
As shown in Table 1,, using CoT increased GPT-4’s performance from 59.6% to 84.0% in March,,
leading to a 24.4% performance boost. On the other hand,, CoT did not help the June version of GPT-4
much: the accuracy was actually 0.1% worse. As we discussed before,, this is because the new version
did not follow the CoT instructions. For GPT-3.5,, an opposite trend was observed: by adding CoT,,
accuracy was marginally better (+6.3% ) in March,, but substantially higher (+15.8%) in June. Since
GPT-3.5 in both March and June followed the CoT instructions. This suggests that LLM drifts could
change both whether andhowto follow user instruction.
Our analysis so far is largely based on shifts of the main metric,, accuracy,, but fine-grained
investigations could disclose additional interesting shift patterns. One observation is that June version
of GPT-4 had a strong bias to view an integer as a composite number. To see so,, we quantified how
the confusion matrices shifted over time. As shown in Figure 4(c),, GPT-4’s June version almost always
identified an integer as composite (49.9%+48.8%=99.7%). GPT-3.5’s March version exhibited a similar

issue. The confusion matrices for GPT-4 in March and GPT-3.5 in June seem more reasonable: they
identified both prime and composite numbers correctly for the major cases. Similar findings have been
recently reported [NK23].
Instance-level investigation discloses additional insights. We uniformly randomly sampled 8 numbers
to manually inspect March GPT-4’s step-by-step logic. March GPT-4’s CoT logic was mostly sound in
these cases,, though it can make arithmetic mistakes,, and it reached the correct conclusion in 7 of the 8
cases. We show 4 examples below and provide the others in the Appendix. For example,, the following
generation by GPT-4 gave the correct reasoning steps for 19997.
Step 1: Check if the number is divisible by 2. Since 19997 is an odd number,, it is not divisible
by 2.
Step 2: Find the square root of the number. The square root of 19997 is approximately 141.4.
Step 3: Check for divisibility by prime numbers less than or equal to the square root. We will
check for divisibility by 3,, 5,, 7,, 11,, 13,, 17,, 19,, 23,, 29,, 31,, 37,, 41,, 43,, 47,, 53,, 59,, 61,, 67,, 71,, 73,,
79,, 83,, 89,, 97,, 101,, 103,, 107,, 109,, 113,, 127,, 131,, 137,, and 139.
19997 is not divisible by any of these prime numbers.
Therefore,, 19997 is a prime number.
Answer: [Yes]
Asking the same query multiple times gives the same conclusion,, though the intermediate reasoning

as it explicitly checked the divisibility of 19997 by each prime number less than it (see Appendix). In
addition,, GPT-4 in March also identified composite numbers divisible by 2 or 5 correctly. For example,,
to determine whether 16450 is prime,, GPT-4 in March wrote the following response.
Step 1: Check if the number is even. If it is,, then it is not prime (except for 2). 16450 is an
even number because it ends in 0.
So,, the answer is [No].
Similarly,, to check 9175,, it gave the following reasoning steps.
Step 1: Find the square root of 9175. The square root of 9175 is approximately 95.78.
Step 2: Check for divisibility by smaller prime numbers (2,, 3,, 5,, 7,, 11,, 13,, 17,, 19,, 23,, 29,, 31,, 37,,
41,, 43,, 47,, 53,, 59,, 61,, 67,, 71,, 73,, 79,, 83,, 89,, 97).
Step 3: 9175 is divisible by 5 (9175 ÷5 = 1835).
Since 9175 is divisible by a prime number other than itself and 1,, it is not a prime number.
Answer: [No]
In both cases,, March GPT-4’s step-by-step logic led to the right answer. However,, it also made
subtle mistakes on some other queries. For example,, to check whether 4323 is a prime number,, it
generated the following content.
- 4323 is not divisible by 3 (4323 / 3 = 1441 with a remainder).
Here,, it actually used the correct logic (checking if 4323 is divisible by any prime numbers),, but
made a mistake in calculation (4323/3 = 1441 exactly without a remainder).
3.2 Math II (Counting Happy Numbers): CoT Also Less Effective
To further investigate ChatGPT’s math problem solving and chain-of-thought behaviors,, we asked it to
tackle a different math problem: counting the number of happy numbers [ Guy04 ,, pp. 357-360] within a
given interval. An integer is called happy if replacing it by the sum of the square of its digits repeatedly
eventually produces 1. For example,, 13 is a happy number because 12+ 32= 10,, and 12+ 02= 1. This
task complements prime testing because it asks for a quantitative response (number of happy numbers)
rather than a binary decision (e.g.,, prime or composite) and it only uses simple arithmetic. To assess
LLM drift on this task,, we constructed a dataset of 500 queries. Each query asks how many happy
numbers there are within a given interval and we quantify how often the LLM gets the correct number
exactly. The interval size was uniformly randomly selected from 6 to 10,, and the interval starting point
was uniformly randomly chosen from 500 to 15,,000. To encourage logic reasoning steps,, we adopt CoT
prompting again.
We also observed significant performance drifts on this task. As shown in Figure 5(a),, GPT-4’s
accuracy dropped from 83.6% in March to 35.2% in June. On the other hand,, accuracy of GPT-3.5
increased from 30.6% to 48.2%. There was also a large change in the verbosity (number of characters
in the generated responses). GPT-4’s generation length dropped from 2163.5 in March to 10.0 in June,,
but GPT-3.5’s length increased by more than 60%. Compared to prime testing (Math I),, the answer
lengths on average were significantly larger due to requiring more steps to enumerate the numbers in
the interval and repeatedly square digits. In addition,, 67.6% of GPT-4’s final answers changed between
March and June,, as did 77.2% of GPT-3.5’s.
As with the prime number testing task,, we observed a large shift in the LLMs’ CoT behaviors. As
shown in Figure 5(b),, GPT-4 in June did not follow the CoT instructions and only gave a final answer,,
while its March counterpart followed the instructions to leverage reasoning steps. GPT-3.5 followed
CoT instructions in both March and June. Its reasoning steps in June were much longer than that in
March. While overall this led to better performance,, sometimes it was problematic due to exceeding
the maximum token length and thus not generating the final answer.

to check each number in this range to see if it is a happy number.
A happy number is a number that,, when repeatedly replaced by the sum of the
squares of its digits,, eventually reaches 1. If it never reaches 1 and instead
enters a cycle,, it is not a happy number.
Let's check each number in the range:
3904: $3^2 + 9^2 + 0^2 + 4^2 = 90$ [...] 3904 is not a happy number.
3905: $3^2 + 9^2 + 0^2 + 5^2 = 91$
[...]
$1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1$
3905 is a happy number. [...]
Out of the numbers between 3904 and 3912,, there are $\boxed{4}$ happy
numbers.First,, we need to know what a happy number is. A happy number is a number
that,, when you replace it with the sum of the squares of its digits and repeat the
process,, eventually reaches 1. For example,, 19 is a happy number because:
$1^2 + 9^2 = 82$
$8^2 + 2^2 = 68$
$6^2 + 8^2 = 100$
$1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1$
Now,, we need to check each number between 3904 and 3912 to see if it is
happy. We can start with 3904: [...]
We have reached a cycle of 37 and 145,, so 3904 is not a happy number. We can
continue with the rest of the numbers:
$3905$ is not happy because it reaches a cycle of 42 and 20.
$3906$ is not happy because it reaches a cycle of 45 and 41.
$3907$ is not happy because it reaches a cycle of 58 and 89.
[...]
Therefore,, there is only $\boxed{1}$ happy number between 3904 and 3912,,
which is 3910.Let's check each number between 3904 and 3912 to see if they are happy
numbers.
3904: 3^2 + 9^2 + 0^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 81 + 0 + 16 = 106
106: 1^2 + 0^2 + 6^2 = 1 + 0 + 36 = 37
37: 3^2 + 7^2 = 9 + 49 = 58
58: 5^2 + 8^2 = 25 + 64 = 89
89: 8^2 + 9^2 = 64 + 81 = 145
145: 1^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 1 + 16 + 25 = 42
42: 4^2 + 2^2 = 16 + 4 = 20
20: 2^2 + 0^2 = 4 + 0 = 4
4: 4^2 = 16
16: 1^2 + 6^2 = 1 + 36 = 37
3904 is not a happy number since it enters a cycle (37,, 58,, 89,, 145,, 42,, 20,, 4,,
16).
3905: [...] 3905 is not a happy number since it enters the same cycle as 3904.
[...]
There are 2 happy numbers between 3904 and 3912: 3907 and 3910.
So,, the answer is \boxed{2}.67.6%

corresponding answers. GPT-4 followed the CoT instructions but ignored it in June. GPT-3.5 followed
CoT in March and June,, and gave a longer reasoning steps in June.
To further understand how the CoT effects’ shifts,, we asked each service the same query either with
or without CoT prompting,, and studied how much accuracy gain was achieved by having CoT. We have
found that CoT’s benefits shifted too. For example,, for GPT-4,, CoT brought 56.6% accuracy boost in
March but only 3.2% in June,, as shown in Table 2. For GPT-3.5,, CoT led to 20.6% performance gains
in June. In March,, however,, CoT caused a 1.6% accuracy drop.
The number of mistakes made by GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 changed over time. But what new mistakes
did they make? To answer this question,, we performed a fine-grained analysis on the confusion matrix
of these LLMs over time,, as shown in Figure 6. It was interesting to note how the bias of GPT-4 and
GPT-3.5 changed over time. GPT-4 in June had a strong belief that there was only 0 or 1 happy
number within any given interval. On the other hand,, GPT-3.5 in June was inclined to overestimate
the number: on more than 10% queries,, it responded that there were more than 4 happy numbers,,
while 4 was actually the upper bound among all our queries. We also ran additional experiments with
smaller intervals for happy numbers and observed similar trends in the LLMs’ behavior (see Appendix).
3.3 Answering Sensitive Questions: Safer but Less Rationale
Prompting LLMs with sensitive questions is known to lead to harmful generations such as social
biases [ GLK+22],, personal information [ CTW+21],, and toxic texts [ GGS+20]. Thus,, another goal of
this paper was to understand how LLM services’ responses to sensitive questions have shifted over
time. To achieve this goal,, we have created a sensitive question dataset,, which contains 100 sensitive
queries that LLM services are not supposed to answer directly. As it is challenging to automatically
evaluate whether a response is indeed a direct answer,, we have manually labelled all responses from the

number most of the time.
monitored LLM services.
We observed two major trends on this task. First,, as shown in Figure 7,, GPT-4 answered fewer
sensitive questions from March (21.0%) to June (5.0%) while GPT-3.5 answered more (from 2.0% to
8.0%). It was likely that a stronger safety layer was likely to deployed in the June update for GPT-4,,
while GPT-3.5 became less conservative. Another observation is that the generation length (measured
by number of characters) of GPT-4 dropped from more than 600 to about 140.
Why did the generation length change? Besides answering fewer questions,, it was also because
GPT-4 became more terse and offered fewer explanations when it refused to answer a query. To see
this,, consider the example shown in Figure 7(b). GPT-4 refused to answer the inappropriate query in
both March and June. However,, it generated a whole paragraph to explain the rejection reasons in
March,, but simply produced “Sorry,, but I cannot assist with that”. A similar phenomenon happened
for GPT-3.5 too. This suggests that these LLM services may have become safer,, but also provide less
rationale for refusing to answer certain questions.
LLM Jailbreaking. Jailbreaking attacks are a major thread to LLM service safety [ GLK+22]. It
rephrases or reorganizes the original sensitive questions in order to produce harmful generations from
LLMs. Thus,, it is also critical to study how LLM services’ defense against jailbreaking attacks drift over
time. Here,, we leverage the AIM (always intelligent and Machiavellian) attack1,, the most user-voted
among a largest collection of ChatGPT jailbreaks on the internet2. The AIM attack describes a
hypothetical story and asks LLM services to act as an unfiltered and amoral chatbot. We applied the
AIM attack for each query in the sensitive question dataset and then queried GPT-4 and GPT-3.5.
The answer rate of their March and June versions was shown in Table 3. There was a large increase

the two versions. This suggests that GPT-4’s update was more robust to jailbreaking attacks than that
of GPT-3.5.
3.4 OpinionQA Survey: Lower Response Rate
LLMs are increasingly leveraged for open-ended text generation,, where bias in the opinions in their
training or fine-tuning data can play an important role. Therefore,, it is vital to understand how
LLMs’ opinion biases change over time. To address this problem,, we leverage OpinionQA [ SDL+23],, a
survey dataset that contains 1,,506 opinion questions. We pick this dataset as its questions were drawn
from high-quality public opinion polls. We followed the multiple-choice question format provided in
[SDL+23],, and added “Pick the best single option” for ease of extracting the answer.
There were substantial and interesting drifts over time on this opinion survey. First,, GPT-4 became
less willing to offer its opinions. As shown in Figure 8(a),, GPT-4’s response rate dropped from 97.6%
in March to 22.1% in June. In contrast,, GPT-3.5’s response rate actually increased by 2%. GPT-3.5
answered almost all questions in both March and June. Yet,, 27% of its opinions changed from March
to June. For comparison,, running GPT-3.5 March twice yields disagreement rate of 2.8% and running
GPT-3.5 June twice yields disagreement rate of 7.0%,, due to LLM’s stochasticity. These indicate

considerable opinion drifts over time above and beyond model’s randomness.
A closer look at how the opinions changed gave us additional insights. As shown in the example
in Figure 8(b),, GPT-4 in March believed that the US will be less important in the world. In June,,
however,, the model refused to answer the question,, because it viewed the question as “subjective” and
thus it simply generated “As an AI,, I don’t have personal opinions”. This illustrates a significant
change in GPT-4’s behavior in responding (or not responding) to subjective questions.
3.5 Code Generation: Less Adherence to Formatting Instructions
One major application of LLMs is code generation [ CTJ+21]. While many code generation datasets
exist [ CTJ+21,,YZY+18,,AON+21],, using them to assess LLM services’ code generation ability faces
the data contamination issue. To overcome this,, we have constructed a new code generation dataset.
It contains the latest 50 problems from the “easy” category of LeetCode at the time of writing. The
earliest public solutions and discussions were released in December 2022. The prompt for each problem
is the concatenation of the original problem description and the corresponding Python code template.
Each LLM’s generation was directly sent to the LeetCode online judge for evaluation. We call it directly
executable if the online judge accepts the answer (i.e.,, the answer is valid Python and passes its tests).
Overall,, the number of directly executable generations dropped from March to June. As shown in
Figure 9 (a),, over 50% generations of GPT-4 were directly executable in March,, but only 10% in June.
The trend was similar for GPT-3.5. There was also a small increase in verbosity for both models.
Why did the number of directly executable generations decline? One possible explanation is that
the June versions consistently added extra non-code text to their generations. Figure 9 (b) gives
one such instance. GPT-4’s generations in March and June are almost the same except two parts.
First,, the June version added ‘‘‘python and‘‘‘before and after the code snippet (likely to format
it as Markdown in UIs). Second,, it also generated a few more comments. While a small change,, the
extra triple quotes render the code not executable. This type of shift in formatting behavior can be
particularly challenging to detect when LLM’s generated code is used inside a larger software pipeline.
We also study whether the generated code passes the LeetCode tests after additional post-processing
that removes the non-code text. As shown in Table 4,, there was again a notable drift: GPT-4’s
performance increased from 52% to 70%,, and there was a 2% improvement for GPT-3.5. While the
code’s correctness improved,, the failure to format the formatting instructions (“generate the code only”)
is still a problematic change in behavior between the two GPT model versions.

EvaluationFigure 9: Code generation . (a) Overall performance drifts. For GPT-4,, the percentage of generations
that are directly executable dropped from 52.0% in March to 10.0% in June. The drop was also large
for GPT-3.5 (from 22.0% to 2.0%). GPT-4’s verbosity,, measured by number of characters in the
generations,, also increased by 20%. (b) An example query and the corresponding responses. In March,,
both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 followed the user instruction ( “the code only” ) and thus produced directly
executable generation. In June,, however,, they added extra triple quotes before and after the code

3.6 LangChain HotpotQA Agent: Poor Prompt Stability
Many real-world applications require LLMs to answer knowledge-intensive questions grounded in various
data sources,, including “multi-hop” questions that involve multiple sources and/or reasoning steps.
Therefore,, it is natural to monitor how LLMs’ ability to answer multi-hop questions evolves over time.
We take a first step by measuring the drifts of a LangChain HotpotQA Agent [ Tea23 ],, a pipeline to
answer complex multi-hop questions similar to those from HotpotQA [ YQZ+18]. This agent leveraged
LLMs to search over Wikipedia passages to answer complex questions. We pick this pipeline for two
reasons. First,, LangChain is one of the most popular software frameworks for working with LLMs,,
providing open source modules that have been “prompt-engineered” to perform various tasks well. The
stability of these modules’ prompts over time is therefore of interest to many users. Second,, HotpotQA
is widely used to measure an LLM’s ability to answer multi-hop questions. Specifically,, we used the
default ReAct Agent in LangChain3(designed to reproduce ReAct prompting [ YZY+22]) with different
LLMs (GPT-4 and GPT-3.5) as the backbone for our code. Then we asked the agent to answer each
query in the HotpotQA dataset.
Overall,, we observed significant drifts for both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 on this task. For example,, the

Figure 10: LangChain HotpotQA Agent. (a) Drifts on exact match,, verbosity,, and mismatch rate.
Overall,, GPT-4 matched more ground-truth while GPT-3.5 became worse. (b) An example query and
corresponding answers. LangChain was not able to parse March GPT-4’s response because it failed to
follow the format specified in the LangChain prompt. GPT-3.5 in June could not find the information
that it was able to obtain in March. These issues highlight the stability issues of integrating LLM into
larger pipelines.
exact match rate for GPT-4 was only 1.2% in March,, but became 37.8% in June,, as shown in Figure
10(a). Opposite trends were observed for GPT-3.5: the exact match rate dropped by almost 9% from
March to June. Moreover,, more than 80% of final answers between March and June did not match for
both models. We also noticed that GPT-4’s generation in June became more concise than in March,,
while GPT-3.5’s generation was 30% more verbose over time.
Why did this happen? A closer look at the mismatched answers suggests the poor prompt stability
as one of the explanations. To see this,, consider the example in Figure 10(b). The query was about
whether two people were Democrats or Republicans. GPT-4 in March was actually able to find the
correct answer: they both were Democrats. However,, the LangChain agent expected a specific format:
the generation from LLM must be “[action]+text”,, which was encoded in its prompts. Unfortunately,,
GPT-4 in March failed to follow this format,, and thus the LangChain agent simply generated an
error message “could not parse LLM Output”. This is problematic in real-world LLM applications,, as
manually debugging such issues is challenging in large pipelines. In addition,, GPT-3.5 in March found
the right answer. In June,, however,, it “was not able to find information”. These issues indicate how
brittle existing prompting methods and libraries can be for complex tasks in the face of LLM drift.
3.7 USMLE Medical Exam: Small Decrease in GPT-4 Performance
We study next how performance of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 change over time on a professional domain:
taking USMLE [ KCM+23],, a medical exam required for doctors in the US. USMLE has been used to
benchmark LLMs’ medical knowledge.
Overall,, we observe a slight performance decrease. As shown in Figure 11(a) ,, GPT-4’s accuracy

June 2023The answer is (B) K+ is Decreased,, Cl ⁻  is decreased,, HCO³ ⁻  is
increased.  
The answer is (A) K+ is Decreased,, Cl ⁻  is decreased,, HCO³ ⁻  is
decreased.The answer is (B) K+ is Decreased,, Cl⁻ is decreased,, HCO³⁻ is
increased. This patient is presenting with symptoms of bulimia
nervosa,, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances due to frequent
vomiting. The decreased K+ and Cl⁻ levels are due to loss through
vomiting,, while the increased HCO³⁻ level is a compensatory
mechanism to counteract the metabolic acidosis caused by the loss
of stomach acid through vomiting. Tender parotid glands and poor
dentition are also common physical ﬁndings in patients with bulimia
nervosa.
Step 1: Analyze the patient's symptoms and history.-The patient is a 20-year-old woman who is a sophomore in
college.- She overeats in response to the stress of her classes and induces vomiting after consuming a signiﬁcant
amount of food.- She vomits almost daily and feels ""too full"" and ""out of control.""- She feels she is slightly
overweight.- She is physically active and exercises moderately two to three times weekly. - She does not use
laxatives or diuretics.- She has many friends and enjoys going out socially. - She drinks three to four beers on
weekends and does not use illicit drugs. - She appears uncomfortable and is tearful and mildly diaphoretic.- She
has tender parotid glands bilaterally and poor dentition.
Step 2: Identify the relevant ﬁndings.  - The patient's BMI is 24 kg/m²,, which indicates she is slightly overweight. -
Her temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F),, pulse is 115/min and regular,, and blood pressure is 100/68 mm Hg. - She has
tender parotid glands bilaterally and poor dentition.
Step 3: Formulate a hypothesis. Based on the patient's symptoms and ﬁndings,, it is likely that she is suﬀering from
bulimia nervosa,, a type of eating disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by
compensatory behaviors such as self-induced vomiting.
Step 4: Determine the expected laboratory ﬁndings. In patients with bulimia nervosa,, the most common electrolyte
abnormalities are hypokalemia (decreased K+),, hypochloremia (decreased Cl⁻),, and metabolic alkalosis (increased
HCO³⁻) due to repeated vomiting and loss of gastric acid.
Step 5: Compare the expected laboratory ﬁndings with the answer choices.The answer choice that matches the
expected laboratory ﬁndings is (A) K+ is Decreased,, Cl⁻ is decreased,, HCO³⁻ is decreased. Therefore,, the answer is
(A) K+ is Decreased,, Cl⁻ is decreased,, HCO³⁻ is decreased.Accuracy Verbosity Mismatch Accuracy Verbosity Mismatcha

dropped from 86.6% to 82.4%. There was also a 0.8% accuracy loss for GPT-3.5. Interestingly,, GPT-3.5
became much more verbose from March to June. It is also worth noting a relatively large answer
mismatch between March and June for both models. In fact,, 12.2% answers in March were different
from their counterparts in June for GPT-4,, and the mismatch rate was 27.9% for GPT-3.5. These two
are much larger than the accuracy changes. This effectively means that the June versions corrected
previous errors but also made additional mistakes. Overall,, we also found that GPT-4 June was much
less verbose in its response compared to GPT-4 March,, while GPT-3.5’s responses to USMLE questions
became longer.
3.8 Visual Reasoning: Small Improvements in Both Models
Finally,, we investigate LLM drifts for visual reasoning. This task differs from other scenarios because it
requires abstract reasoning. The ARC dataset [ Cho19 ] is commonly used to assess visual reasoning
ability. The task is to create a output grid corresponding to an input grid,, based solely on a few similar
examples. Figure 12(b) gives one example query from ARC. To show the visual objects to LLM services,,
we represent the input and output grids by 2-D arrays,, where the value of each element denotes the
color. We fed the LLM services 467 samples in the ARC dataset that fits in all services’ context window.

EvaluationFigure 12: Visual reasoning . (a) Overall performance. For both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5,, there was a
2% improvement of the exact match rate from March to June. The generation length remained roughly
the same. More than 60% generation changed from March to June. (b) An example query and the
corresponding responses. While overall GPT-4 became better over time,, it was worse on this particular
query. It gave the correct grid in March but the wrong one in June.
Then we measured the exact match between their generation and the ground truth.
As shown in Figure 12(a),, there were marginal performance improvements for both GPT-4 and
GPT-3.5. However,, for more than 90% visual puzzle queries,, the March and June versions produced
the exact same generation. These services’ overall performance were also low: 27.4% for GPT-4 and
12.2% for GPT-3.5.
It is worthy noting that LLM services did not uniformly make better generations over time. In
fact,, despite better overall performance,, GPT-4 in June made mistakes on queries on which it was
correct for in March. Figure 12(b) gives one such example. This underlines the need of fine-grained
drift monitoring,, especially for critical applications.
4 Is GPT-4’s instruction following getting worse over time?
How to interpret the observed behavior drift? In our experiments,, decrease in LLM’s performance is
often associated with worse instruction following (i.e. worse ability in following users’ instructions). On
the Math I and Math II tasks,, for example,, GPT-4 followed the user instructions to perform step-by-step
reasoning and then answer the questions in March,, but refused to do so in June. OpinionQA offers
another example: GPT-4 responded to users’ questions in March but did not respond in June.
Quantifying instruction following drift on single instructions. Quantifying instruction following
drift on existing LLM benchmarks is challenging: their tasks and evaluation metrics often blur a model’
instruction fidelity and its task-specific abilities (such as writing and logic reasoning) and knowledge
(commonsense,, history,, etc). Hence,, we have curated a new benchmark focused on task-agnostic
instructions. This includes four types of instructions that often arise in practice: answer extractions (
“answer yes or no within squared brackets”),, stop apologizing (“do not say sorry or as an AI model”),,
writing constraint (“describe X by words starting/ending with Y ”),, and text formatting (“add squared
brackets to each single word’s first letter (including article word like ‘the’).”). We apply answer
extraction and text formatting on the abstracts of 200 recent arxiv papers,, and content filtering on the
senstiveQA dataset. We manually created 20 style refinement queries.
As shown in Figure 13,, there was indeed a large instruction fidelity drop of GPT-4 from March
to June. For example,, GPT-4 followed 99.5% answer extraction queries in March,, while the number

TaskInstruction F ollowingFigure 13: GPT-4’s instruction following on individual instructions. (a) Overall instruction
following. (b) example responses by GPT-4. In a nutshell,, GPT-4 followed most individual instructions
in March,, but ignored them in June. Consider answer extraction as an example: 99.5% queries were
followed by GPT-4 in March,, but the number became almost 0 in June. Similarly,, the fidelity rate
dropped from 74.0% in March to 19.0% in June on the content filtering queries. The example response
revealed some infidelity patterns of GPT-4 in June. It insisted on capitalizing the letter (answer
extraction),, kept generating “sorry” when users asked not to do it (stop apologizing),, ignoring the word
ending letters (writing constraint),, and missed a few letter to add brackets (text formatting).
dropped to 0.5% in June. On 74% sensitive questions,, GPT-4 mentioned no “sorry” or “as an AI model”
as the instructions request in March. However,, this number became only 19% in June. The examples
given in Figure 13 offer more insights on what led to June version’s low fidelity. For example,, GPT-4
in June did place the answer in the squared brackets,, but it consistently capitalize the first letter.
Similarly,, while users asked not to say sorry,, GPT-4 kept generating sorry in June,, while its March
version rephrased its answer to follow the user request. On the writing constraint example,, GPT-4 in
March followed the user instruction exactly: it generated words related to machine learning and ending
in “n”. The June version,, however,, focused on “machine learning” but ignored the “ending with ‘n’
” requirement. GPT-4 successfully capitalized first letter for each word in March,, but missed a few
words (such as “provides” and “about” in the shown example) in June. Overall,, GPT-4’s instruction
following fidelity decreased from March to June,, which partially explained its behavior drifts.
Instruction following drift on composite instructions. We further study how GPT-4’s instruction
following changes on compositions of instructions. To quantify this,, we collected a set of single
instructions,, and then created a list of composite instructions,, each of which corresponds to two
instructions from the single instruction set. We evaluated GPT-4’s performance on these composite

Example responses by GPT-4 to individual and composite instructions. Overall,, GPT-4 became more

instructions “add comma” and “capitalize” remained roughly the same between March and June.
However,, to process their composition,, the accuracy dropped by 9.2% from March to June.
instructions applied on arxiv papers’ first sentences. The single instruction set contains three text
formatting instructions: add comma (“add a comma to each word”),, no quotation (“remove quotations”),,
and capitalize (“capitalize each letter”). These instructions are easy to understand by humans and also
commonly seen in real-world applications.
There are several interesting observations. First,, GPT-4 followed the single instructions well in
both March and June. In fact,, the instruction following shifts on individual instructions are only -2%,,
+4.0%,, and -1.0% from March to June (Figure 14 (a)). Second,, GPT-4 in June was much prune to
composite instructions than that in March. For example,, when asked to remove quotations as well as
add a comma to each word,, GPT-4’s performance dropped by 24% from March to June. Similarly,,
switching from March to June caused a 9.2% accuracy drop on the composition of adding a comma
and capitalizing letters. It is interesting to recognize the mistake patterns triggered by the composition.
As shown in the example from Figure 14,, GPT-4 in June tended to add a comma to each character
when given the composite instruction. On the other hand,, its March counterpart faithfully completed
the user task.
Overall,, we observe that GPT-4 followed less user instructions over time. This holds for both
single instructions and composite instructions. Consistent with the performance shifts analyzed in the

comparison,, there was not a consistent change in GPT-3.5’s instruction following over time (see Figure
16 in the Appendix).
5 Conclusions and Future Work
Our findings demonstrate that the behavior of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 has varied significantly over a
relatively short amount of time. This highlights the need to continuously evaluate and assess the
behavior of LLM drifts in applications,, especially as it is not transparent how LLMs such as ChatGPT
are updated over time. Our study also underscores the challenge of uniformly improving LLMs’
multifaceted abilities. Improving the model’s performance on some tasks,, for example with fine-tuning
on additional data,, can have unexpected side effects on its behavior in other tasks. Consistent with
this,, both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 got worse on some tasks but saw improvements in other dimensions.
Moreover,, the trends for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are often divergent. Beyond the final performances,, it’s
interesting to observe shifts in chain-of-thought behaviors and verbosity of the models.
We plan to update the findings presented here in an ongoing long-term study by regularly evaluating
GPT-3.5,, GPT-4 and other LLMs on diverse tasks over time. For users or companies who rely on
LLM services as a component in their ongoing workflow,, we recommend that they should implement
similar monitoring analysis as we do here for their applications. We thank the many people who have
provided helpful feedback to our work. To encourage further research on LLM drifts,, we have release
our evaluation data and ChatGPT responses at https://github.com/lchen001/LLMDrift .

Step 2: Check for divisibility by prime numbers less than 51.45 (2,, 3,, 5,, 7,, 11,, 13,, 17,, 19,, 23,, 29,,
31,, 37,, 41,, 43,, 47).
2647 is not divisible by 2 (it’s odd). 2647 is not divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 19,, which is not
divisible by 3). 2647 is not divisible by 5 (it doesn’t end in 0 or 5).
2647 is not divisible by 7 (2647/7 = 377.857,, not a whole number).
2647 is not divisible by 11 (2647/11 = 240.636,, not a whole number).
2647 is not divisible by 13 (2647/13 = 203.615,, not a whole number).
2647 is not divisible by 17 (2647/17 = 155.706,, not a whole number).
2647 is not divisible by 19 (2647/19 = 139.316,, not a whole number).
2647 is not divisible by 23 (2647/23 = 115.087,, not a whole number).
2647 is not divisible by 29 (2647/29 = 91.276,, not a whole number).

ABSTRACT
The ML community is rapidly exploring techniques for prompting language mod-
els (LMs) and for stacking them into pipelines that solve complex tasks. Un-
fortunately,, existing LM pipelines are typically implemented using hard-coded
“prompt templates”,, i.e. lengthy strings discovered via trial and error. Toward a
more systematic approach for developing and optimizing LM pipelines,, we intro-
duce DSPy,, a programming model that abstracts LM pipelines as text transforma-
tion graphs ,, i.e. imperative computation graphs where LMs are invoked through
declarative modules. DSPy modules are parameterized ,, meaning they can learn
(by creating and collecting demonstrations) how to apply compositions of prompt-
ing,, finetuning,, augmentation,, and reasoning techniques. We design a compiler
that will optimize any DSPy pipeline to maximize a given metric. We conduct
two case studies,, showing that succinct DSPy programs can express and optimize
sophisticated LM pipelines that reason about math word problems,, tackle multi-
hop retrieval,, answer complex questions,, and control agent loops. Within minutes
of compiling,, a few lines of DSPy allow GPT-3.5 andllama2-13b-chat to self-
bootstrap pipelines that outperform standard few-shot prompting (generally by
over 25% and 65%,, respectively) and pipelines with expert-created demonstra-
tions (by up to 5–46% and 16–40%,, respectively). On top of that,, DSPy pro-
grams compiled to open and relatively small LMs like 770M-parameter T5and
llama2-13b-chat are competitive with approaches that rely on expert-written
prompt chains for proprietary GPT-3.5 .
DSPy is available at https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy .
1 I NTRODUCTION
Language models (LMs) are enabling researchers to build NLP systems at higher levels of abstrac-
tion and with lower data requirements than ever before (Bommasani et al.,, 2021). This is fueling an
exploding space of “prompting” techniques—and lightweight finetuning techniques—for adapting
LMs to new tasks (Kojima et al.,, 2022),, eliciting systematic reasoning from them (Wei et al.,, 2022;
Wang et al.,, 2022b),, and augmenting them with retrieved sources (Guu et al.,, 2020; Lazaridou et al.,,
2022; Khattab et al.,, 2022) or with tools (Yao et al.,, 2022; Schick et al.,, 2023). Most of these tech-
niques are explored in isolation,, but interest has been growing in building multi-stage pipelines and
agents that decompose complex tasks into more manageable calls to LMs in an effort to improve
performance (Qi et al.,, 2019; Khattab et al.,, 2021a; Karpas et al.,, 2022; Dohan et al.,, 2022; Khot
et al.,, 2022; Khattab et al.,, 2022; Chen et al.,, 2022; Pourreza & Rafiei,, 2023; Shinn et al.,, 2023).
Unfortunately,, LMs are known to be sensitive to how they are prompted for each task,, and this is
exacerbated in pipelines where multiple LM calls have to interact effectively. As a result,, the LM

calls in existing LM pipelines and in popular developer frameworks are generally implemented using
hard-coded ‘prompt templates’,, that is,, long strings of instructions and demonstrations that are hand
crafted through manual trial and error. We argue that this approach,, while pervasive,, can be brittle
and unscalable—conceptually akin to hand-tuning the weights for a classifier. A given string prompt
might not generalize to different pipelines or across different LMs,, data domains,, or even inputs.
Toward a more systematic approach to designing AI pipelines,, we introduce the DSPy programming
model.1DSPy pushes building new LM pipelines away from manipulating free-form strings and
closer to programming (composing modular operators to build text transformation graphs) where a
compiler automatically generates optimized LM invocation strategies and prompts from a program.
We draw inspiration from the consensus that emerged around neural network abstractions (Bergstra
et al.,, 2013),, where (1) many general-purpose layers can be modularly composed in any complex
architecture and (2) the model weights can be trained using optimizers instead of being hand-tuned.
To this end,, we propose the DSPy programming model (Sec 3). We first translate string-based
prompting techniques,, including complex and task-dependent ones like Chain of Thought (Wei et al.,,
2022) and ReAct (Yao et al.,, 2022),, into declarative modules that carry natural-language typed sig-
natures . DSPy modules are task-adaptive components—akin to neural network layers—that abstract
any particular text transformation,, like answering a question or summarizing a paper. We then pa-
rameterize each module so that it can learn its desired behavior by iteratively bootstrapping useful
demonstrations within the pipeline. Inspired directly by PyTorch abstractions (Paszke et al.,, 2019),,
DSPy modules are used via expressive define-by-run computational graphs. Pipelines are expressed
by (1) declaring the modules needed and (2) using these modules in any logical control flow (e.g.,,
ifstatements,, forloops,, exceptions,, etc.) to logically connect the modules.
We then develop the DSPy compiler (Sec 4),, which optimizes any DSPy program to improve quality
or cost. The compiler inputs are the program,, a few training inputs with optional labels,, and a valida-
tion metric. The compiler simulates versions of the program on the inputs and bootstraps example
traces of each module for self-improvement,, using them to construct effective few-shot prompts
or finetuning small LMs for steps of the pipeline. Optimization in DSPy is highly modular: it is
conducted by teleprompters ,,2which are general-purpose optimization strategies that determine how
the modules should learn from data. In this way,, the compiler automatically maps the declarative
modules to high-quality compositions of prompting,, finetuning,, reasoning,, and augmentation.
Programming models like DSPy could be assessed along many dimensions,, but we focus on the role
of expert-crafted prompts in shaping system performance. We are seeking to reduce or even remove
their role through DSPy modules (e.g.,, versions of popular techniques like Chain of Thought) and
teleprompters. We report on two expansive case studies: math word problems (GMS8K; Cobbe et al.
2021) and multi-hop question answering (HotPotQA; Yang et al. 2018) with explorations of chain
of thought,, multi-chain reflection,, multi-hop retrieval,, retrieval-augmented question answering,, and
agent loops. Our evaluations use a number of different compiling strategies effectively and show
that straightforward DSPy programs outperform systems using hand-crafted prompts,, while also
allowing our programs to use much smaller and hence more efficient LMs effectively.
Overall,, this work proposes the first programming model that translates prompting techniques into
parameterized declarative modules and introduces an effective compiler with general optimiza-
tion strategies (teleprompters) to optimize arbitrary pipelines of these modules. Our main contri-
butions are empirical and algorithmic: with DSPy,, we have found that we can implement very
short programs that can bootstrap self-improving multi-stage NLP systems using LMs as small as
llama2-13b-chat andT5-Large (770M parameters). Without hand-crafted prompts and within
minutes to tens of minutes of compiling,, compositions of DSPy modules can raise the quality of
simple programs from 33% to 82% (Sec 6) and from 32% to 46% (Sec 7) for GPT-3.5 and,, simi-
larly,, from 9% to 47% (Sec 6) and from 22% to 41% (Sec 7) for llama2-13b-chat .
1DSPy is pronounced dee-ess-pie . It’s the second iteration of our earlier Demonstrate–Search–Predict
framework (DSP; Khattab et al. 2022). This paper introduces the key concepts in DSPy. For more extensive and
up-to-date documentation of the framework,, we refer readers to https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy .
2We derive the name tele-prompters from the notion of abstracting and automating the task of prompting,,
in particular,, such that it happens at a distance ,, without manual intervention.

2 R ELATED WORK
This work is inspired by the role that Torch (Collobert et al.,, 2002),, Theano (Bergstra et al.,, 2010;
2011; Al-Rfou et al.,, 2016),, Chainer (Tokui et al.,, 2015),, and others played in the development in
deep learning by providing powerful abstractions. A similar transformation is emerging with higher-
level pipelines of LMs,, and we are seeking to offer a solid conceptual framework and programming
abstractions for what we call foundation model programming . We draw on differentiable program-
ming (Wang et al.,, 2018) but applied to LM calls rather than neural networks,, and borrow syntactic
elements from PyTorch (Paszke et al.,, 2019).
In-context learning (McCann et al. 2018; Radford et al. 2018; Brown et al. 2020) is a key mechanism
for foundation model programming. A growing body of work has revealed that,, especially with
instruction tuning (Ouyang et al.,, 2022),, we can elicit sophisticated behavior via prompting (Wei
et al.,, 2022; Wang et al.,, 2022b; Press et al.,, 2022; Yao et al.,, 2022; Khot et al.,, 2022; Madaan et al.,,
2023). Similarly,, forms of weak supervision that would normally require task-specific (Khattab
et al.,, 2021a;b) or hand-built (Ratner et al.,, 2016; Hancock et al.,, 2018) heuristics are now done by
LMs (Wang et al.,, 2022b; Zelikman et al.,, 2022; Zhang et al.,, 2022; Shao et al.,, 2023).
In-context learning methods now routinely invoke tools,, leading to LM pipelines that use retrieval
models (Chen et al.,, 2017; Lewis et al.,, 2020; Guu et al.,, 2020; Lazaridou et al.,, 2022; Izacard et al.,,
2022),, multimodal foundation models,, and more traditional tools like APIs (Nakano et al.,, 2021)
and calculators. A number of toolkits have been developed to facilitate this,, including LangChain
(Chase,, 2022),, Semantic Kernel (Microsoft,, 2023),, LlamaIndex (Liu,, 2022),, and many other re-
trieval and agent libraries. These toolkits provide pre-packaged chains and agents that connect
LMs with numerous accessible tools. However,, they suffer from the pervasive prompt engineering
challenges we address in DSPy: they express task-specific behavior through hand-written prompt
templates (for detailed discussion,, see Appendix B).
Researchers are starting to apply discrete optimization and RL to find effective prompts,, generally
for a single logical LM call (Guo et al.,, 2023; Pryzant et al.,, 2023; Huang et al.,, 2022; Yang et al.,,
2023). DSPy seeks to generalize this space: it offers a rich framework for optimizing arbitrary
pipelines from high-level declarative signatures ,, by bootstrapping high-quality multi-stage demon-
strations with constraints. In this framework,, DSPy teleprompters may apply optimization using
model selection techniques like cross-validation or,, in principle,, with sophisticated techniques in-
volving RL and LM feedback (Hu et al.,, 2023; Zhao et al.,, 2023a; Shinn et al.,, 2023) or learned or
Bayesian hyperparameter optimization methods (Bergstra et al.,, 2013; Akiba et al.,, 2019).
The present paper seeks to motivate DSPy as a programming model and to report new empirical
findings from applying the DSPy compiler. This is inspired by formative work by Bergstra et al.
(2010; 2013),, Paszke et al. (2019),, and Wolf et al. (2020),, who support their respective programming
models with a mix of benchmark numbers and some qualitative measures. For the current paper,, we
focus on showing that DSPy and its compiler allow us to build outstanding LM systems without
hand-crafted prompt strings,, but instead from truly modular units,, and that this opens up doors for
systematically exploring a rich design space at a very high programmatic level of abstraction.
3 T HEDSP YPROGRAMMING MODEL
We present DSPy,, which treats LMs as abstract devices for text generation,,3and optimizes their us-
age in arbitrary computational graphs. DSPy programs are expressed in Python: each program takes
the task input (e.g.,, a question to answer or a paper to summarize) and returns the output (e.g.,, an
answer or a summary) after a series of steps. DSPy contributes three abstractions toward automatic
optimization: signatures,, modules,, and teleprompters. Signatures abstract the input/output behavior
of a module; modules replace existing hand-prompting techniques and can be composed in arbitrary
pipelines; and teleprompters optimize all modules in the pipeline to maximize a metric.
3We assume access to one or more LMs,, which consume a prompt string and return text completions. This
may be a promptable LM capable of in-context learning (e.g.,, GPT-3.5 or Llama2-7b) or a smaller finetuneable
LM (e.g.,, T5-base). An LM may be selected as the default; operations will use it unless configured otherwise.

3.1 N ATURAL LANGUAGE SIGNATURES CAN ABSTRACT PROMPTING &FINETUNING
Instead of free-form string prompts,, DSPy programs use natural language signatures to assign work
to the LM. A DSPy signature is natural-language typed declaration of a function: a short declarative
spec that tells DSPy what a text transformation needs to do (e.g.,, “consume questions and return
answers”),, rather than how a specific LM should be prompted to implement that behavior. More
formally,, a DSPy signature is a tuple of input fields andoutput fields (and an optional instruction ).
A field consists of field name and optional metadata.4In typical usage,, the roles of fields are inferred
by DSPy as a function of field names. For instance,, the DSPy compiler will use in-context learning
to interpret question differently from answer and will iteratively refine its usage of these fields.
Signatures offer two benefits over prompts: they can be compiled into self-improving and pipeline-
adaptive prompts or finetunes. This is primarily done by bootstrapping (Sec 4) useful demonstrating
examples for each signature. Additionally,, they handle structured formatting and parsing logic to
reduce (or,, ideally,, avoid) brittle string manipulation in user programs.
In practice,, DSPy signatures can be expressed with a shorthand notation like question -> answer ,,
so that line 1 in the following is a complete DSPy program for a basic question-answering system
(with line 2 illustrating usage and line 3 the response when GPT-3.5 is the LM):
1qa = dspy.Predict(""question -> answer"")
2qa(question=""Where is Guaran ´ı spoken?"")
3# Out: Prediction(answer=’Guaran ´ı is spoken mainly in South America.’)
In the shorthand notation,, each field’s name indicates the semantic role that the input (or output)
field plays in the transformation. DSPy will parse this notation and expand the field names into
meaningful instructions for the LM,, so that english document -> french translation would
prompt for English to French translation. When needed,, DSPy offers more advanced programming
interfaces for expressing more explicit constraints on signatures (Appendix A).
3.2 P ARAMETERIZED &TEMPLATED MODULES CAN ABSTRACT PROMPTING TECHNIQUES
Akin to type signatures in programming languages,, DSPy signatures simply define an interface and
provide type-like hints on the expected behavior. To use a signature,, we must declare a module with
that signature,, like we instantiated a Predict module above. A module declaration like this returns
afunction having that signature.
ThePredict Module The core module for working with signatures in DSPy is Predict (simplified
pseudocode in Appendix D.1). Internally,, Predict stores the supplied signature,, an optional LM to
use (initially None ,, but otherwise overrides the default LM for this module),, and a list of demon-
strations for prompting (initially empty). Like layers in PyTorch,, the instantiated module behaves as
a callable function: it takes in keyword arguments corresponding to the signature input fields (e.g.,,
question ),, formats a prompt to implement the signature and includes the appropriate demonstra-
tions,, calls the LM,, and parses the output fields. When Predict detects it’s being used in compile
mode,, it will also internally track input/output traces to assist the teleprompter at bootstrapping the
demonstrations.
Other Built-in Modules DSPy modules translate prompting techniques into modular functions that
support any signature,, contrasting with the standard approach of prompting LMs with task-specific
details (e.g.,, hand-written few-shot examples). To this end,, DSPy includes a number of more sophis-
ticated modules like ChainOfThought ,,ProgramOfThought ,,MultiChainComparison ,, andReAct .5
These can all be used interchangeably to implement a DSPy signature. For instance,, simply chang-
4String descriptions of the task and the fields are also optional and usually omitted. Fields can carry optional
field prefix anddescription . By default,, fields are assumed to hold free-form strings; we are actively exploring
optional data type as a way to specify constraints on valid values (e.g.,, bool orint) and more gracefully handle
formatting and parsing logic,, though this feature is not core to DSPy at the time of writing.
5These modules generalize prompting techniques from the literature,, respectively,, by Wei et al. (2022),,
Chen et al. (2022),, Yoran et al. (2023),, and Yao et al. (2022) and,, in doing so,, generalize the ideas on zero-shot

ingPredict toChainOfThought in the above program leads to a system that thinks step by step
before committing to its output field.
Importantly,, all of these modules are implemented in a few lines of code by expanding the user-
defined signature and calling Predict one or more times on new signatures as appropriate. For
instance,, we show a simplified implementation of the built-in ChainOfThought below.
1class ChainOfThought(dspy.Module):
2def __init__(self,, signature):
3 # Modify signature from ‘*inputs -> *outputs‘ to ‘*inputs -> rationale,, *outputs‘.
4 rationale_field = dspy.OutputField(prefix=""Reasoning: Let’s think step by step."")
5 signature = dspy.Signature(signature).prepend_output_field(rationale_field)
6
7 # Declare a sub-module with the modified signature.
8 self.predict = dspy.Predict(signature)
9
10def forward(self,, **kwargs):
11 # Just forward the inputs to the sub-module.
12 return self.predict(**kwargs)
This is a fully-fledged module capable of learning effective few-shot prompting for any LM or task.
We contrast that with Appendix C,, which copies long reasoning prompts hand-written by sources
ranging from recent research to popular prompting libraries.
Parameterization Uniquely,, DSPy parameterizes these prompting techniques. To understand this
parameterization,, observe that any LM call seeking to implement a particular signature needs to
specify parameters that include: (1) the specific LM to call (Chen et al.,, 2023),, (2) the prompt in-
structions (Yang et al.,, 2023) and the string prefix of each signature field and,, most importantly,, (3)
the demonstrations used as few-shot prompts (for frozen LMs) or as training data (for finetuning).
We focus primarily on automatically generating and selecting useful demonstrations. In our case
studies,, we find that bootstrapping good demonstrations gives us a powerful way to teach sophisti-
cated pipelines of LMs new behaviors systematically.
Tools DSPy programs may use tools,, which are modules that execute computation. We support re-
trieval models through a dspy.Retrieve module. At the time of writing,, DSPy has built-in support
for ColBERTv2,, Pyserini,, and Pinecone retrievers,, and we have explored experimental dspy.SQL
for executing SQL queries and dspy.PythonInterpreter for executing Python code in a sandbox.
Programs DSPy modules can be composed in arbitrary pipelines in a define-by-run interface. In-
spired directly by PyTorch and Chainer,, one first declares the modules needed at initialization,, allow-
ing DSPy to keep track of them for optimization,, and then one expresses the pipeline with arbitrary
code that calls the modules in a forward method. As a simple illustration,, we offer the following
simple but complete retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system.
1class RAG(dspy.Module):
2def __init__(self,, num_passages=3):
3 # ‘Retrieve‘ will use the user’s default retrieval settings unless overriden.
4 self.retrieve = dspy.Retrieve(k=num_passages)
5 # ‘ChainOfThought‘ with signature that generates answers given retrieval & question.
6 self.generate_answer = dspy.ChainOfThought(""context,, question -> answer"")
7
8def forward(self,, question):
9 context = self.retrieve(question).passages
10 return self.generate_answer(context=context,, question=question)
To highlight modularity,, we use ChainOfThought as a drop-in replacement of the basic Predict .
One can now simply write RAG()(""Where is Guaran ´ı spoken?"") to use it. Notice that,, if we
use a signature ""context,, question -> search query"" ,, we get a system that generates search
queries rather than answers.
3.3 T ELEPROMPTERS CAN AUTOMATE PROMPTING FOR ARBITRARY PIPELINES
When compiling a DSPy program,, we generally invoke a teleprompter ,, which is an optimizer that
takes the program,, a training set,, and a metric—and returns a new optimized program. Different
teleprompters (Sec 4) apply different strategies for optimization.
5",1b947eb6a8679989fe175d74de107fb7
2024-04-08 02:25:51.200,460814,file:/Workspace/Users/odl_instructor_771155@databrickslabs.com/raw_pdfs/2310.03714.pdf,"Preprint
In DSPy,, training sets may be small ,, potentially a handful of examples,, though larger data enables
more powerful optimization. Training examples may be incomplete ,, i.e.,, only input values are nec-
essary. Labels for the pipeline steps are not required,, unless they need to be used in the metric. In
practice,, we typically assume labels only for (at most) the program’s final output,, not the intermedi-
ate steps. This label-efficiency is critical for modularity: building a new pipeline in DSPy requires
simply recompiling the new pipeline’s code,, not annotating data specific to the new pipeline.
Metrics can be simple notions like exact match (EM) or F1,, but they can be entire DSPy programs
that balance multiple concerns. For example,, we may compile the RAG module above against a
dataset of question–answer pairs qatrainset and the metric EM. The goal of optimization here is
to effectively bootstrap few-shot demonstrations. The following code achieves this:
1# Small training set with only questions and final answers.
2qa_trainset = [dspy.Example(question=""What is the capital of France?"",, answer=""Paris"")]
3
4# The teleprompter will bootstrap missing labels: reasoning chains and retrieval contexts.
5teleprompter = dspy.BootstrapFewShot(metric=dspy.evaluate.answer_exact_match)
6compiled_rag = teleprompter.compile(RAG(),, trainset=qa_trainset)
In this example,, the BootstrapFewShot teleprompter (Sec 4,, Appendix E.1) simulates RAGon the
training example(s). It will collect demonstrations of each module (i.e.,, examples of its input–output
behavior) that collectively lead to valid output (i.e.,, respecting the signatures and the metric).
If one wanted to push the compiled program to be extractive given its retrieved contexts,, one could
define a custom metric to use in place of dspy.evaluate.answer exactmatch :
1def answer_and_context_match(example,, pred,, trace=None):
2answer_match = dspy.evaluate.answer_exact_match(example,, pred)
3
4# Is the prediction a substring of some passage?
5context_match = any((pred.answer.lower() in c) for c in pred.context)
6
7return answer_match and context_match
Notice that behavior like this might be more accurately checked by another DSPy program that
checks for faithful grounding of answers. Such metrics are fully supported and encouraged in DSPy.
Teleprompters can be composed by specifying a teacher program. DSPy will sample demonstra-
tions from this program for prompt optimization. This composition can enable very rich pipelines,,
where expensive programs (e.g.,, complex expensive ensembles using large LMs) supervise cheap
programs (e.g.,, simple pipelines using smaller LMs). One may start with compiled ragfrom above
(say,, compiled to use a large Llama2-13b-chat LM) but now fine-tune Flan-T5-large to create an
efficient program:
1# Larger set of questions with *no labels*. Labels for all steps will be bootstrapped.
2unlabeled_questions = [dspy.Example(question=""What is the capital of Germany?""),, ...]
3
4# As we assumes no answer,, we use ‘answer_passage_match‘ to filter ungrounded answers.
5finetuning_teleprompter = BootstrapFinetune(metric=dspy.evaluate.answer_passage_match)
6
7# We set ‘teacher=compiled_rag‘ to compose. Bootstrapping will now use ‘compiled_rag‘.
8compiled_rag_via_finetune = finetuning_teleprompter.compile(RAG(),, teacher=compiled_rag,,
trainset=unlabeled_questions,, target=’google/flan-t5-large’)
4 T HEDSP YCOMPILER
A key source of DSPy’s expressive power is its ability to compile—or automatically optimize—any
program in this programming model. Compiling relies on a teleprompter,, which is an optimizer for
DSPy programs that improves the quality (or cost) of modules via prompting or finetuning,, which
are unified in DSPy. While DSPy does not enforce this when creating new teleprompters,, typical
teleprompters go through three stages.
Stage 1: Candidate Generation The compiler first (recursively) finds all unique Predict modules
(predictors) in a program,, including those nested under other modules. For each unique predictor
p,, the teleprompter may generate candidate values for the parameters of p: the instructions,, field
descriptions,, or—most importantly—demonstrations (i.e.,, example input–output pairs). In this iter-

2024-04-08 02:25:51.200,460814,file:/Workspace/Users/odl_instructor_771155@databrickslabs.com/raw_pdfs/2310.03714.pdf,"Preprint
ation of DSPy,, we focus on demonstrations and find that simple rejection-sampling-like approaches
can help bootstrap highly effective multi-stage systems.
Consider the simplest non-trivial teleprompter in DSPy,, BootstrapFewShot (simplified pseudocode
in Appendix E.1). This teleprompter will simulate a teacher program (or,, if unset,, the zero-shot
version of the program being compiled) on some training inputs,, possibly one or more times with
a high temperature. When running in compile mode,, multi-stage traces are tracked transparently
and in a thread-safe fashion throughout execution. The program’s metric is used to filter for multi-
stage traces that together help the pipeline pass the metric. We thus obtain potential labels for all
signatures in the program by throwing away the bad examples and using the good examples as
potential demonstrations,, though these design decisions are under user control.
While LMs can be highly unreliable,, we find they can be rather efficient at searching the space
of solutions for multi-stage designs. A well-decomposed program can typically find at least a few
training examples where the LM can pass the constraints enforced by the signatures and metrics,,
allowing us to bootstrap iteratively if needed.
Stage 2: Parameter Optimization Now each parameter has a discrete set of candidates: demon-
strations,, instructions,, etc. Many hyperparameter tuning algorithms (e.g.,, random search or Tree-
structured Parzen Estimators as in HyperOpt (Bergstra et al.,, 2013) and Optuna (Akiba et al.,, 2019))
can be applied for selection among candidates. We report simplified implementations of DSPy’s
BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch andBootstrapFewShotWithOptuna in Appendix E.2 and
Appendix E.3.
Another type of optimization is finetuning withBootstrapFinetune ,, where the demonstrations are
used to update the LM’s weights for each predictor. When this is applied,, the LM parameter of each
module is updated to the new LM weights. Typically,, we are optimizing average quality using the
metric with cross-validation over the training set or a validation set. This is applicable even with no
labels for any stages,, depending on the nature of metric.
Stage 3: Higher-Order Program Optimization A different type of optimization that the DSPy
compiler supports is modifying the control flow of the program. One of the simplest forms of
these is ensembles,, which we use in the case studies in this work. An ensemble will bootstrap
multiple copies of the same program,, and then replace the program with a new one that runs them
all in parallel and reduces their predictions into one with a custom function (e.g.,, majority voting).
In future work,, this stage can easily accommodate techniques for more dynamic (i.e.,, test-time)
bootstrapping as well as automatic backtracking-like logic.
5 G OALS OF EVALUATION
Programming frameworks can be evaluated along many dimensions: computational efficiency,, de-
veloper efficiency,, intuitiveness of the code and concepts,, and so forth. In this paper,, we focus on
perhaps the most pressing issue for current LM pipelines: the role of hand-written,, task-specific
prompts in achieving performant systems. Our evaluations seek to test the following hypotheses:
H1With DSPy,, we can replace hand-crafted prompt strings with concise and well-defined
modules,, without reducing quality or expressive power.
H2Parameterizing the modules and treating prompting as an optimization problem makes
DSPy better at adapting to different LMs,, and it may outperform expert-written prompts.
H3The resulting modularity makes it possible to more thoroughly explore complex pipelines
that have useful performance characteristics or that fit nuanced metrics.
Our evaluation will explore these hypotheses using diverse task–program pairs. We hope this begins
a shift from underspecified questions like “how do different LMs compare on GSM8K” toward “how
they compare on GSM8K with program P when compiled with strategy S”,, which is a well-defined
and reproducible run. Ultimately,, our goal is to reduce the role of artful prompt construction in
modern AI in favor of the development of new modular,, composable programs and optimizers.

6 C ASE STUDY : M ATH WORD PROBLEMS
We evaluate on the popular GSM8K dataset with grade school math questions (Cobbe et al.,, 2021).
We sample 200 and 300 question–answer pairs from the official training set for training and develop-
ment,, respectively. Our final evaluations use the 1.3k official test set examples. We report extensive
comparisons on the development set to avoid overfitting on test. Following prior work on GSM8K,,
we evaluate the accuracy of the final numerical value that appears in the LM output.
Programs Considered For this task,, we consider three simple DSPy programs: a one-step Pre-
dict module ( vanilla ),, a two-step ChainOfThought module ( CoT),, and finally a multi-stage Com-
parerOfThoughts module ( ThoughtReflection ). These are fully defined by the following code:
1vanilla = dspy.Predict(""question -> answer"") # GSM8K Program ‘vanilla‘
2
3CoT = dspy.ChainOfThought(""question -> answer"") # GSM8K Program ‘CoT‘
1class ThoughtReflection(dspy.Module):
2def __init__(self,, num_attempts):
3 self.predict = dspy.ChainOfThought(""question -> answer"",, n=num_attempts)
4 self.compare = dspy.MultiChainComparison(’question -> answer’,, M=num_attempts)
5
6def forward(self,, question):
7 completions = self.predict(question=question).completions
8 return self.compare(question=question,, completions=completions)
9
10reflection = ThoughtReflection(num_attempts=5) # GSM8K Program ‘reflection‘
Inreflection ,, five reasoning chains are sampled from the LM (alongside their answers) and they
are compared in parallel by a built-in MultiChainComparison module,, which generalizes Yoran
et al. (2023). This generates a new answer taking into account the patterns from the five attempts.
Critically,, the modules used are all generic,, none is specific math problems or particular LM.
Compiling As we discussed in Section 4,, DSPy programs can be compiled into new,, optimized
programs. In our experiments,, we evaluate the programs zero-shot (no compiling) as well as a
number of strategies for compiling. Our simplest compiler is LabeledFewShot :
1fewshot = dspy.LabeledFewShot(k=8).compile(program,, trainset=trainset)
Here,,program can be any DSPy module. This simply samples k=8random demonstrations from the
trainset for the fields common to the training examples and the signature(s),, in this case,, question
andanswer ,, but not the reasoning for instance. We report the average of 3–5 runs (depending on the
setting) when applying such random sampling.

Next,, we also consider bootstrapping few-shot examples with random search:
1tp = BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch(metric=gsm8k_accuracy)
2bootstrap = tp.compile(program,, trainset=trainset,, valset=devset)
This will generate demonstration chains for examples in the training set and optimize the selection
of demonstrations (from this set) to self-improve the program’s modules. As the name indicates,, this
is done with random search,, treating the selection of demonstrations as a parameter to optimize.
Next,, if desired,, this bootstrapping process can be nested in DSPy. In particular,, we can use the
optimized bootstrap program itself to further bootstrap another program. This is relevant,, for
example,, whenever the original zero-shot program performs relatively poorly.
1bootstrap2 = tp.compile(program,, teacher=bootstrap,, trainset=trainset,, valset=devset)
And lastly,, we consider ensembling these bootstraps:
1# A program that ensembles the top-7 candidate programs from a bootstrapping compiler run
(in particular ‘bootstrap‘ or,, when applicable,, ‘bootstrap2‘) with majority voting.
2ensemble = Ensemble(reduce_fn=dspy.majority).compile(bootstrap.programs[:7])
GSM8K includes human reasoning chains. Above,, trainset does not include these reasoning
chains. We also evaluate with trainset humanCoT,, which extends the examples in trainset with
the human reasoning string. These two datasets can be used interchangeably as the value for the
trainset parameter above. We note here that compiling generally runs on the order of minutes
(or tens of minutes) as even the more expensive settings only require running the program a few
thousand times (e.g.,, 10–20 trials over 150–300 validation examples) and they can occur in parallel.
Results Our results are summarized in Table 1,, which includes dev results as well as our evaluation
of promising representatives of each approach on the test set. First,, the vanilla program results
show that GPT-3.5 andllama2-13b-chat struggle with math word problems when they have to
predict the answers directly,, that is,, without using a reasoning chain first. This is most pronounced
in the absence of good demonstrations,, which can be seen in the none compilation setting (i.e.,,
zero-shot instruction) and the fewshot setting (i.e.,, sampling random question–answer pairs). In-
terestingly,, however,, vanilla is helped substantially by compiling with bootstrap and by iterating
this process into bootstrap ×2. On inspecting the prompts bootstrapped (Appendix F),, we see that
the prompt allows the LM to leverage the answer field for reasoning first,, which is permitted as the
metric extracts the final numerical value for evaluation.
Next,, we consider the CoTprogram. While the expert human reasoning chains ( +humanCoT) provide
a large boost when available,, we can match or surpass this using bootstrap ,, substantiating our
hypothesis that DSPy can cut the need for hand-crafted prompts. Beyond this,, we see that the
reflection program,, while only a few lines longer than the others,, is a clear winner,, though CoTis
quite effective with ensemble . Overall,, the bootstrap compilation procedure leads to large gains
for every program,, across both LMs. Indeed,, all programs in this table are expressed by composing
two to four DSPy modules and teleprompters,, and they reveal overall that—in the new paradigm
prescribed by DSPy—it’s composing the right generic modules ,, rather than manipulating string
prompts,, that improves different LMs from 4–20% accuracy to 49–88% accuracy.
We can informally compare with the following. Zhang et al. (2022) reports 48% for
text-davinci-002 ,, which aligns closely with our llama2-13b-chat results,, and reports 59.4%
with codex when employing a manual CoT approach and 62.8% with an automatic CoT method.
Wang et al. (2022b) report 57% for CoT prompting with PaLM 540-B,, which becomes 74% upon
adding self-consistency. The Llama2 authors (Touvron et al.,, 2023) presents 28.7% for llama2-13b ,,
42.2% for llama2-34b ,, and 56.8% for llama2-70b . Intriguingly,, our program with the 13b variant
of the model is competitive with their 34b-based results even though we don’t use human reasoning
chains in our program. Zhao et al. (2023b) reports 80.8% for CoT with gpt-3.5-turbo from April
2023. The GPT-4 authors (OpenAI,, 2023) reports that GPT-3.5 scores 57.1% and GPT-4 elevates
this to 92% but they note that GPT-4 was in fact pre-trained on a subset of GSM8K’s training set.

7 C ASE STUDY : COMPLEX QUESTION ANSWERING
In this case study,, we explore the multi-hop question answering task with the HotPotQA (Yang et al.,,
2018) dataset in the open-domain “fullwiki” setting. For retrieval,, we use a search index of the of-
ficial Wikipedia 2017 “abstracts” dump of HotPotQA. Search is conducted by a ColBERTv2 (San-
thanam et al.,, 2021) retriever. The HotPotQA test set is hidden,, so we reserve the official validation
set for our testing,, and sample 1000 examples for that. We sub-divide the training set into 70%/30%
train/validation splits. In the training (and thus validation) split,, we keep only examples marked as
“hard” in the original dataset,, which matches the designation of the official validation and test sets.
For training and for reporting development results,, we sample 200 and 300 examples respectively.
Programs Considered Our simplest baseline is the vanilla program used in the previous case
study on GSM8K (Sec 6); the ""question -> answer"" signature is universal enough that it will
work for this task (and many others) when compiled appropriately.
Our baseline RAG program is the one given in Section 3.2 as a simple example of RAG with a
dspy.ChainOfThought layer. We will see that this program does not excel at HotPotQA,, and this
motivates us to evaluate two multi-hop programs.
To that end,, we first test ReAct (Yao et al.,, 2022),, a multi-step agent for tool use,, which is imple-
mented as a built-in module in DSPy. In the simplest case,, a ReAct module for a particular signature
can be declared as follows in DSPy:
1react = dspy.ReAct(""question -> answer"",, tools=[dspy.Retrieve(k=1)],, max_iters=5)
We also test the following custom program,, which simulates the information flow in Baleen (Khattab
et al.,, 2021a) and IRRR (Qi et al.,, 2020) and has similarities to IRCoT (Trivedi et al.,, 2022).
1class BasicMultiHop(dspy.Module):
2def __init__(self,, passages_per_hop):
3 self.retrieve = dspy.Retrieve(k=passages_per_hop)
4 self.generate_query = dspy.ChainOfThought(""context,, question -> search_query"")
5 self.generate_answer = dspy.ChainOfThought(""context,, question -> answer"")
6
7def forward(self,, question):
8 context = []
9
10 for hop in range(2):
11 query = self.generate_query(context=context,, question=question).search_query
12 context += self.retrieve(query).passages
13
14 return self.generate_answer(context=context,, question=question)
15
16multihop = BasicMultiHop(passages_per_hop=3)
Compiling For compilers,, we continue to use the ones that we used for GSM8K (see Sec 6). We
also consider two compositions of our teleprompters. For ReAct,, we consider bootstrapping with
BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch starting from an earlier bootstrap of the ReAct program.
For the simple multihop program,, we also consider fine-tuning with T5-Large starting from the
earlier bootstrap of that program.
1multihop_t5 = dspy.BootstrapFinetune(metric=answer_exact_match).compile(program,,
teacher=bootstrap,, trainset=trainset,, target=’t5-large’)
Results Table 2 summarizes our results. Compared with the vanilla few-shot prompting,, a chain-
of-thought and retrieval-augmented generation ( CoTRAG) program can self-bootstrap in DSPy to
increase answer EM substantially. However,, this relies entirely on the ColBERTv2 retriever to find
relevant passages directly from the original questions,, limiting its passage recall. This is tackled in
thereact andmultihop programs,, which will generate queries for the retriever in multiple iterative
“hops”. Indeed,, overall,, a simple multihop program performs the best,, and in general bootstrap
again proves to be very effective at raising its quality relative to its fewshot variant for both LMs.
In particular,, we can see that bootstrap (and/orbootstrap ×2) can outperform both fewshot
prompting (for multihop ) and expert human reasoning (for react ; adapted slightly from Yao et al.
(2022) to our retrieval setting). Perhaps most importantly,, we can make llama2-13b-chat compet-
itive with GPT-3.5 by simply compiling our programs.
To assess the finetuning capacity of DSPy,, we also evaluated the compiler multihop t5defined
above which produces a T5-Large (770M parameter) model. This program scores 39.3% answer
EM and 46.0% passage accuracy on the dev set,, using only 200 labeled inputs and 800 unlabeled

questions. For compiling,, we use a teacher program consisting of an ensemble (union) of two
multihop withllama2-13b-chat . Considering its extremely small size and local availability,, this
compiled program with T5-Large would impose orders of magnitude lower costs for inference than
a proprietary LM like GPT-3.5.
Our results may be pegged against the evaluation on HotPotQA in a number of recent papers,, though
there is significant variation in evaluation methodology and test set samples across studies in this
space. Using CoT prompting,, Si et al. (2022) achieve 25.2% EM. With a “recite-and-answer” tech-
nique that uses PaLM-62B (Chowdhery et al.,, 2022) to recite evidence passages,, Sun et al. (2022)
achieve 26.5% EM. Wang et al. (2022a) achieve 33.8% EM and 44.6% F1 when applying self-
consistency for PaLM-540B. Yao et al. (2022) achieve 27.4% EM using ReAct with PaLM-540B
and 30.8 with text-davinci-002 ,, with a tool giving it the ability for search using a Wikipedia
API. They push their PaLM results to 35.1% EM by applying an additional CoT step with self-
consistency,, which may resemble our ensemble approach in the sense of aggregating multiple an-
swers. Trivedi et al. (2022) reports 49% using a pipeline with code-davinci-002 LM on a sample
of 500 HotPotQA questions.
8 C ONCLUSION
This paper introduced DSPy,, a new programming model for designing AI systems using pipelines
of pretrained LMs and other tools. We presented three new concepts introduced in this abstraction
(DSPy signatures,, modules,, and teleprompters),, and showed in two very different case studies that
it supports rapid development of highly effective systems that use relatively small LMs. We have
maintained open-source versions of this framework for close to a year. In this period,, we have seen
and created a large number of programs that were compiled to high-quality systems by DSPy,, span-
ning tasks from information extraction to low-resource synthetic data generation. In the interest of
space and to maintain reasonable scope in this paper,, we leave reporting on such tasks under con-
trolled experimental conditions to future work. While in-context learning has proved transformative
over the past 2–3 years of LM research,, we argue that the true expressive power in this emerging
paradigm is in building sophisticated text transformation graphs in which composable modules and
optimizers (teleprompters) come together to leverage LMs in more systematic and reliable ways.

A A DVANCED SIGNATURES
When more control is desired,, one can express signatures as Python classes to provide explicit
instructions of the transformation and describe the format or role of each field more directly. For
instance,, the following signature generates search queries using context and an optional question:
1class GenerateSearchQuery(dspy.Signature):
2""""""Write a simple search query that will help answer a complex question.""""""
3
4context = dspy.InputField(desc=""may contain relevant facts"")
5question = dspy.InputField()
6query = dspy.OutputField(dtype=dspy.SearchQuery)
Using the above,, we can specify a complete system for the generation of a synthetic IR dataset where
the queries are mediated by a question generated by the LM:
1query_gen = dspy.Predict(GenerateSearchQuery)
2query_gen(context=""Language typology"")
3# Out: Prediction(question=’What are the main types of language classification?’,,
query=’""language classification"" OR ""language typology"" -wikipedia’)
If questions are available,, they can be supplied as shown: querygen(context=""Language
typology"",, question=""What are the primary language families of South America?"") .
As a work in progress feature,, users can optionally specify the type of output fields as bool,, int,,
float,, list ,, ordict instead of the default free-form string type,, as in contexts,, question ->
answerfound: bool .
B C OMPARISON WITH EXISTING LIBRARIES LIKE LANG CHAIN AND
LLAMA INDEX
LangChain and LlamaIndex are perhaps the most popular library in the general space of prompting
LMs. These libraries have a different focus compared to DSPy and they suffer internally from the
prompt engineering challenges that DSPy aims to resolve. In particular,, whereas the goal of DSPy
is to tackle the fundamental challenges of prompt engineering for building new LM computational
graphs,, LangChain and LlamaIndex generally help application developers who need pre-packaged
components and chains,, e.g.,, implementations of popular and reusable pipelines (e.g.,, particular
agents and specific retrieval pipelines) and tools (e.g.,, connections to various databases and imple-
mentations of long- and short-term memory for agents).
These off-the-shelf higher-level abstractions contrast with DSPy’s focus on introducing core com-
posable operators. In particular,, DSPy introduces signatures (to abstract prompts),, modules (to
abstract prompting techniques),, and teleprompters to act as optimizers for arbitrary imperative code
(DSPy programs) that chain modules together. Its goal is to help researchers and practitioners
build new LM pipelines quickly and achieve very high quality through automatic compilation (self-
improvement) instead of manual prompt engineering.
In contrast,, typical existing research implementations and existing libraries like LangChain and
LlamaIndex are implemented using manual prompt engineering,, which is the key problem that DSPy
tackles. We conducted an informal study to highlight this. In late September 2023,, we found
that the LangChain codebase contains 50 strings exceeding 1000 characters,, which are generally
prompts,, compared to none at all in DSPy. Indeed,, a substantial number of LangChain’s Python
files are singularly dedicated to task-related templating and prompt engineering with 12 prompts.py
files and and 42 prompt.py files. DSPy,, on the other hand,, provides a structured framework that
automatically bootstraps prompts. The library itself does not contain a single hand-written prompt
demonstration for any tasks at the time of writing,, despite the very high quality with various LMs.
To review the typical forms of prompt engineering in existing libraries,, we consider the follow-
ing in LangChain. The LangChain Program-Aided Language Model Gao et al. (2023a) chain pro-
gram uses few-shot learning,, leveraging a template that is 3982 characters long with 8 math word
problems (Prompt 2) and corresponding outputted programs as learning examples for the language

icantly lengthy prompt templates,, with averages of 1337 and 722 characters,, respectively. While
expert-written prompts can be useful,, we believe that LM- and task-adaptive prompts bootstrapped
automatically can offer far more power (and are far more modular) than hard-coding a prompt per
database provider inside the code base. The next appendix section contains a number of prompts
copied from related research papers and existing libraries.
C S AMPLE LARGE PROMPTS
This section highlights a few popular existing frameworks that structure prompts with extensive
prompt engineering templates. The primary objective is to capture how many words and characters
are used for such large multi-line prompts defined for tasks or tools and present these example
prompts retrieved from open-sourced papers and repositories. The formatting of these example
prompts is adapted from Gao et al. (2023a).

1 [web] I will check some things you said.
2
3 (1) You said: Your nose switches back and forth between nostrils. When you sleep,, you switch about every 45 minutes. This
is to prevent a buildup of mucus. It’s called the nasal cycle.
4 I checked: How often do your nostrils switch?
5 I found this article: Although we don’t usually notice it,, during the nasal cycle one nostril becomes congested and thus
contributes less to airflow,, while the other becomes decongested. On average,, the congestion pattern switches about every
2 hours,, according to a small 2016 study published in the journal PLOS One.
6 Your nose’s switching time is about every 2 hours,, not 45 minutes.
7 This disagrees with what you said.
8
9 (2) You said: The Little House books were written by Laura Ingalls Wilder. The books were published by HarperCollins.
10 I checked: Who published the Little House books?
11 I found this article: These are the books that started it all -- the stories that captured the hearts and imaginations of
children and young adults worldwide. Written by Laura Ingalls Wilder and published by HarperCollins,, these beloved books
remain a favorite to this day.
12 The Little House books were published by HarperCollins.
13 This agrees with what you said.
14
15 (3) You said: The Stanford Prison Experiment was conducted in the basement of Jordan Hall,, Stanford’s psychology building.
16 I checked: Where was Stanford Prison Experiment conducted?
17 I found this article: Carried out August 15-21,, 1971 in the basement of Jordan Hall,, the Stanford Prison Experiment set
out to examine the psychological effects of authority and powerlessness in a prison environment.
18 The Stanford Prison Experiment was conducted in Jordan Hall.
19 This agrees with what you said.
20
21 (4) You said: Social work is a profession that is based in the philosophical tradition of humanism. It is an intellectual
discipline that has its roots in the 1800s.
22 I checked: When did social work have its roots?
23 I found this article: The Emergence and Growth of the Social work Profession<br><br> Social work’s roots were planted in
the 1880s,, when charity organization societies (COS) were created to organize municipal voluntary relief associations and
settlement houses were established.
24 Social work has its roots in the 1880s,, not 1800s.
25 This disagrees with what you said.
26
27 (5) You said: The Havel-Hakimi algorithm is an algorithm for converting the adjacency matrix of a graph into its adjacency
list. It is named after Vaclav Havel and Samih Hakimi.
28 I checked: What is the Havel-Hakimi algorithm?
29 I found this article: The Havel-Hakimi algorithm constructs a special solution if a simple graph for the given degree
sequence exists,, or proves that one cannot find a positive answer. This construction is based on a recursive algorithm.
The algorithm was published by Havel (1955),, and later by Hakimi (1962).
30 Havel-Hakimi algorithm is for constructing a special solution if a simple graph for the given degree sequence exists,, or
proving that one cannot find a positive answer,, not converting the adjacency matrix of a graph into its adjacency list.
31 This disagrees with what you said.
32
33 (6) You said: ""Time of My Life"" is a song by American singer-songwriter Bill Medley from the soundtrack of the 1987 film
Dirty Dancing. The song was produced by Michael Lloyd.
34 I checked: Who was the producer of ""(I’ve Had) The Time of My Life""?
35 I found this article: On September 8,, 2010,, the original demo of this song,, along with a remix by producer Michael Lloyd,,
was released as digital files in an effort to raise money for the Patrick Swayze Pancreas Cancer Resarch Foundation at
Stanford University.
36 ""Time of My Life"" was produced by Michael Lloyd.
37 This agrees with what you said.
38
39 (7) You said: Kelvin Hopins was suspended from the Labor Party because he had allegedly sexually harassed and behaved
inappropriately towards a Labour Party activist,, Ava Etemadzadeh.
40 I checked: Why was Kelvin Hopins suspeneded from the Labor Party?
41 I found this article: A former Labour MP has left the party before an inquiry into sexual harassment allegations against
him was able to be concluded,, the party has confirmed. Kelvin Hopkins was accused in 2017 of inappropriate physical contact
and was suspended by the Labour party pending an investigation.This agrees with what you said.
42 Kelvin Hopins was suspended because he had allegedly sexually harassed and behaved inappropriately towards a Labour Party
activist,, Ava Etemadzadeh.
43 This agrees with what you said.
44
45 (8) You said: In the battles of Lexington and Concord,, the British side was led by General Thomas Smith.
46 I checked: Who led the British side in the battle of Lexington and Concord?
47 I found this article: Interesting Facts about the Battles of Lexington and Concord. The British were led by Lieutenant
Colonel Francis Smith. There were 700 British regulars.
48 The British side was led by Lieutenant Colonel Francis Smith,, not General Thomas Hall.
49 This disagrees with what you said.

Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.
23 Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again.
24 Tonight,, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans.
25 With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution.
26 And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny.
27 Six days ago,, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to
his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated.

34 We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all,, so much loss of life.
35 Let’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A
God-awful disease.
36 Let’s stop seeing each other as enemies,, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.
37 We can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward|on COVID-19 and other issues we must face
together.
38 I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner,,
Officer Jason Rivera.
39 They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun.
40 Officer Mora was 27 years old.
41 Officer Rivera was 22.
42 Both Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers.
43 I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice,, and we will carry on their
mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

45 Content: And a proud Ukrainian people,, who have known 30 years of independence,, have repeatedly shown that they will not
tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.
46 To all Americans,, I will be honest with you,, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator,, invading a foreign country,, has
costs around the world.
47 And I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every
tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers.
48 Tonight,, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil
from reserves around the world.
49 America will lead that effort,, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready
to do more if necessary,, unified with our allies.

21 FINAL ANSWER:
Figure 5: Langchain example prompt for QA with sources.
1 You are a MyScale expert. Given an input question,, first create a syntactically correct MyScale query to run,, then look
at the results of the query and return the answer to the input question.
2 MyScale queries has a vector distance function called DISTANCE(column,, array) to compute relevance to the user’s question
and sort the feature array column by the relevance.
3 When the query is asking for {topk}closest row,, you have to use this distance function to calculate distance to entity’s
array on vector column and order by the distance to retrieve relevant rows.
4 *NOTICE*: DISTANCE(column,, array) only accept an array column as its first argument and a NeuralArray(entity) as its second
argument. You also need a user defined function called NeuralArray(entity) to retrieve the entity’s array.
5 Unless the user specifies in the question a specific number of examples to obtain,, query for at most {topk}results using
the LIMIT clause as per MyScale. You should only order according to the distance function.
6 Never query for all columns from a table. You must query only the columns that are needed to answer the question. Wrap
each column name in double quotes ("") to denote them as delimited identifiers.
7 Pay attention to use only the column names you can see in the tables below. Be careful to not query for columns that do
not exist. Also,, pay attention to which column is in which table.
8 Pay attention to use today() function to get the current date,, if the question involves ""today"". ORDER BY clause should
always be after WHERE clause. DO NOT add semicolon to the end of SQL. Pay attention to the comment in table schema.

1 You are an IRS chatbot whose primary goal is to help users with filing their tax returns for the 2022 year.
2 Provide concise replies that are polite and professional.
3 Answer questions truthfully based on official government information,, with consideration to context provided below on
changes for 2022 that can affect tax refund.
4 Do not answer questions that are not related to United States tax procedures and respond with ""I can only help with any
tax-related questions you may have."".
5 If you do not know the answer to a question,, respond by saying \I do not know the answer to your question. You may be able
to find your answer at www.irs.gov/faqs""

7 Changes for 2022 that can affect tax refund:
8 Changes in the number of dependents,, employment or self-employment income and divorce,, among other factors,, may affect
your tax-filing status and refund. No additional stimulus payments. Unlike 2020 and 2021,, there were no new stimulus
payments for 2022 so taxpayers should not expect to get an additional payment.
9 Some tax credits return to 2019 levels. This means that taxpayers will likely receive a significantly smaller refund
compared with the previous tax year. Changes include amounts for the Child Tax Credit (CTC),, the Earned Income Tax Credit
(EITC) and the Child and Dependent Care Credit will revert to pre-COVID levels.
10 For 2022,, the CTC is worth $2,,000 for each qualifying child. A child must be under age 17 at the end of 2022 to be a
qualifying child. For the EITC,, eligible taxpayers with no children will get $560 for the 2022 tax year. The Child and
Dependent Care Credit returns to a maximum of $2,,100 in 2022.
11 No above-the-line charitable deductions. During COVID,, taxpayers were able to take up to a $600 charitable donation tax
deduction on their tax returns. However,, for tax year 2022,, taxpayers who don’t itemize and who take the standard deduction,,
won’t be able to deduct their charitable contributions.
12 More people may be eligible for the Premium Tax Credit. For tax year 2022,, taxpayers may qualify for temporarily expanded
eligibility for the premium tax credit.
13 Eligibility rules changed to claim a tax credit for clean vehicles. Review the changes under the Inflation Reduction Act
of 2022 to qualify for a Clean Vehicle Credit.

13 Answer: Jimmy picks out 3 shorts at $15 each = $45. Irene grabs 5 shirts at $17 each = $85. Total cost = $45 + $85 = $130.
Since senior citizens get a 10% discount,, they will pay 10% of $130 = $13. So,, they will give the cashier $130 - $13 =

14 Reasoning: Let’s think step by step in order to find out how many minutes it takes Mark to finish making the bread. We know
that he needs to let it rise for 120 minutes twice,, so that’s 240 minutes. Then,, he needs to spend 10 minutes kneading it

and spends $1200 on the whole operation. How much money is Mr. Ben remaining with?
20 Reasoning: Let’s think step by step in order to find out how much money Mr. Ben is remaining with. We know that he had
$2000 to begin with,, and he spent $600 on goods from his supplier,, so he has $2000 - $600 = $1400 left. Then,, his debtor
paid him $800,, so he has $1400 + $800 = $2200. Finally,, he spent $1200 on equipment maintenance,, so he has $2200 - $1200
=$1000 left.

Abstract
Evaluating retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) systems traditionally relies on hand
annotations for input queries,, passages to re-
trieve,, and responses to generate. We introduce
ARES,, an Automated RAG Evaluation System ,,
for evaluating RAG systems along the dimen-
sions of context relevance,, answer faithfulness,,
and answer relevance. Using synthetic training
data,, ARES finetunes lightweight LM judges
to assess the quality of individual RAG compo-
nents. To mitigate potential prediction errors,,
ARES utilizes a small set of human-annotated
datapoints for prediction-powered inference
(PPI). Across six different knowledge-intensive
tasks in KILT and SuperGLUE,, ARES accu-
rately evaluates RAG systems while using a
few hundred human annotations during evalu-
ation. Furthermore,, ARES judges remain ef-
fective across domain shifts,, proving accurate
even after changing the type of queries and/or
documents used in the evaluated RAG systems.
We make our datasets and code for replication
and deployment available at https://github.
com/stanford-futuredata/ARES .
1 Introduction
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has be-
come a prominent approach for building user-
facing NLP applications,, such as systems for ques-
tion answering (QA),, fact-checking,, and customer
support (Petroni et al.,, 2021; Wang et al.,, 2019).
Typically,, a RAG system consists of a retriever
and a downstream language model. Given a user
question,, the retriever finds relevant passages from
a corpus (e.g.,, a company’s internal knowledge
base) and the language model uses these passages
to generate a response. This formulation admits a
multitude of choices: what retrieval model to use,,
how to divide the documents into retrieval chunks,,
and how to prompt or finetune the language model
to use the retrieved information,, to name only a few
of the simplest design decisions.The best design for a RAG system is not neces-
sarily universal across data domains,, corpus sizes,,
and cost/latency budgets. To tune their own RAG
systems,, practitioners traditionally need hand an-
notations for test questions,, passages to retrieve
(to assess the retriever),, and responses to generate,,
labeled specifically for their target domain. Alter-
natively,, they may evaluate different approaches in
production by collecting human preferences that
compare the candidate systems. Unfortunately,,
both of these strategies demand high expertise and
impose considerable annotation costs.
Model-based evaluation has emerged as cheap
and automatic strategy to test generative output
quality (Zheng et al.,, 2023). For instance,, the open-
source RAGAS (James and Es,, 2023) framework
is an attempt at prompting a language model for
evaluating the relevance of retrieved information
and the faithfulness andaccuracy of generated re-
sponses. Unfortunately,, such strategies currently
rely for evaluation on a fixed set of heuristically
hand-written prompts,, offering little adaptability to
various evaluation contexts.
To evaluate RAG systems rapidly and accu-
rately,, we propose ARES,, the Automated RAG
Evaluation System. ARES is the first automated
RAG evaluation system to generate tailored LLM
judges for each component of a RAG pipeline,, lead-
ing to substantial boosts in evaluation precision and
accuracy compared to existing approaches like RA-
GAS. Furthermore,, unlike existing RAG evaluation
systems,, ARES provides statistical guarantees for
its predictions by leveraging prediction-powered
inference (PPI),, generating confidence intervals for
its scoring. Given a particular corpus of documents
and a RAG system,, ARES reports three evaluation
scores: context relevance (i.e.,, is the retrieved in-
formation pertinent to the test question),, answer
faithfulness (i.e.,, is the response generated by the
language model properly grounded in the retrieved
context),, and answer relevance (i.e.,, is the responsearXiv:2311.09476v1  [cs.CL]  16 Nov 2023",9517786ecadf3e0c75e3cd4ccefdced5
2024-04-08 02:25:51.044,437986,file:/Workspace/Users/odl_instructor_771155@databrickslabs.com/raw_pdfs/2311.09476.pdf,"also relevant to the question). A good RAG system
find relevant contexts and generates answers that
are both faithful and relevant.
Many existing RAG evaluation frameworks re-
quire substantial human annotations for scoring.
ARES significantly improves data efficiency dur-
ing evaluation by only requiring three inputs: a set
of passages from the target corpus,, a human pref-
erence validation set of 150 annotated datapoints
or more,, and five few-shot examples of in-domain
queries and answers,, which are used for prompting
LLMs in synthetic data generation. Given the cor-
pus of in-domain passages,, ARES proceeds in three
stages. First,, it leverages a language model to con-
struct a synthetic dataset of question–answer pairs,,
derived from the passages in the corpus. Second,,
ARES defines three separate judge models to per-
form three classification tasks (context relevance,,
answer faithfulness,, and answer relevance). These
judges are lightweight models fine-tuned against a
contrastive learning objective. Third,, ARES ranks
the different RAG systems being assessed using
prediction-powered inference (PPI; Angelopoulos
et al. 2023) to improve model-based evaluation ac-
curacy and provide statistical confidence intervals
for RAG scoring. PPI utilizes a small set of human
annotated datapoints for computing its confidence
intervals; we designate this annotated set as our hu-
man preference validation set ,, which is composed
of 150 annotated datapoints or more that designate
both positive and negative examples for context rel-
evance,, answer faithfulness,, and answer relevance.
This work makes the following contributions.
First,, we propose the ARES framework for eval-
uating the context relevance,, answer faithfulness,,
and answer relevance of RAG systems using only
the corpus passages and a human preference val-
idation set of 150 datapoints or more. Second,,
we offer a novel development pipeline for fine-
tuning lightweight LLMs on synthetically gen-
erated queries and answers. We further bolster
our lightweight LLM judges by using prediction-
powered inference (PPI) and human annotations
to provide statistical guarantees to ARES scoring
of RAG systems. Third,, we conduct extensive
empirical evaluations,, demonstrating that ARES
accurately scores RAG systems across the six
knowledge-intensive datasets in KILT and Super-
GLUE,, beating existing automated evaluation ap-
proaches like RAGAS by 59.29 and 14.4 percent-
age points on average across context relevance and
answer relevance evaluation accuracy,, respectively.We also find that ARES consistently distinguishes
competitive RAG systems that are only a few points
apart in ground-truth metrics. This precision en-
ables ARES to guide the development and compar-
ison of competitive approaches and configurations.
We provide the datasets and code for replicating
and deploying ARES on Github.
2 Related Work
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG; Guu et al.
2020; Lewis et al. 2020; Khattab et al. 2021; Izac-
ard et al. 2022) is now a common strategy for bol-
stering LLMs by combining them with retrieval
systems. Through retrieval,, RAG helps LM sys-
tems gather domain-specific knowledge,, ground
generations in factual information (Shuster et al.,,
2021; Huo et al.,, 2023),, and offer a degree of trans-
parency or interpretability via citing sources (Mi-
alon et al.,, 2023).
LLM-based evaluation techniques have emerged
for gauging LLM systems. This is essential for
rapid deployment in new settings,, where it is im-
practical to build a traditional benchmark dataset
from scratch. Early attempts at this use LLMs
out of the box,, like in MT-Bench and Chatbot
Arena (Zheng et al.,, 2023). AutoCalibrate (Liu
et al.,, 2023b) seeks to align an LLM-judge with
human preferences,, leveraging a self-refinement
prompt to iteratively improve the LLM judge.
Other work has used LLM prompting to evaluate
system quality across natural language generation
tasks,, such as translation,, summarization,, and dia-
logue generation (Kocmi and Federmann,, 2023; Fu
et al.,, 2023; Liu et al.,, 2023a; Wang et al.,, 2023).
In the context of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks,,
LLMs have been explored for assessing attribution
and factuality in LLMs (Min et al.,, 2023; Gekhman
et al.,, 2023; Yue et al.,, 2023). New guidelines like
LongEval (Krishna et al.,, 2023) and datasets like
Hagrid and ALCE (Kamalloo et al.,, 2023; Gao
et al.,, 2023) provide resources for analyzing evalu-
ating knowledge-intensive LLM pipelines.
The two most-closely related projects to our
work are EXAM (Sander and Dietz,, 2021) and RA-
GAS (James and Es,, 2023). To evaluate RAG sys-
tems,, the EXAM metric estimates how many exam
questions a reader (simulated as a QA system) can
answer correctly based on the generated response.
The EXAM metric requires a set of queries with
several associated sub-questions each,, which adds
a substantial burden that ARES does not require.",e47b43c9c8f8ce11d78342c49ddbea07

a handful of simple hand-written prompts. These
heuristic prompts offer little adaptability to new
RAG evaluation settings (e.g.,, new corpora) and,,
as we show in our evaluation,, substantially under-
performs ARES.
3 ARES
The ARES evaluation framework proceeds in three
stages,, which we illustrate in Figure 1. ARES
requires three inputs for the pipeline: a set of pas-
sages from the target corpus,, a human preference
validation set of 150 annotated datapoints or more,,
and five few-shot examples of in-domain queries
and answers,, which are used for prompting LLMs
in synthetic data generation. With our inputs pre-
pared,, we begin by generating synthetic queries
(and their answers) from the passages in the target
corpus. We then use these query–passage–answer
triples to train our LLM judges (e.g.,, for detecting
answer relevance). Subsequently,, we apply these
judges to any RAG system,, scoring a sample of its
in-domain query-document-answer triples,, and use
prediction-powered inference (PPI) with our hu-
man preference validation set to reliably estimate
a confidence interval for the quality of each RAG
system.
3.1 LLM Generation of Synthetic Dataset
We generate synthetic queries and answers from
the corpus passages using generative LLMs. The
generated data represent both positive and negative
examples of query–passage–answer triples (e.g.,,
relevant/irrelevant passages and correct/incorrect
answers). For generation,, the LLM uses our in-
put set of few-shot examples with in-domain pas-
sages mapped to in-domain queries and answers;
the model then generates a synthetic question and
answer from a given in-domain passage,, allowing
us to create both positive and negative training ex-
amples. We include example prompts for generat-
ing synthetic queries and answers in A.5.
For creating our synthetic data,, we primarily rely
on FLAN-T5 XXL (discussed in subsection 4.1).
ARES works well with this model (see section 5)
but our system can ultimately use another high-
quality model for generating synthetic queries and
answers. To filter out low-quality queries,, we verify
that a given query can retrieve its original passage
as the top result using its retriever system. The
filtering approach has been used in previous workto isolate high-quality synthetic queries (Dai et al.,,
2022; Saad-Falcon et al.,, 2023).
To generate negatives for fine-tuning our LLM
judges,, we rely on two novel strategies,, generating
the same number of negatives with each strategy:
1.Weak Negative Generation : For context rel-
evance negatives,, we randomly sample in-
domain passages unrelated to a given syn-
thetic query. For answer faithfulness and
answer relevance negatives,, we randomly
sample synthetically-generated answers from
other passages,, which were created using
FLAN-T5 XXL.
2.Strong Negative Generation : For context
relevance negatives,, we randomly sample in-
domain passages from the same document as
the gold passage. For datasets in which mul-
tiple passages are not available for the same
document,, we use BM25 to retrieve the top-
10 passages similar to the passage and sample
from them for our context relevance strong
negatives. For answer faithfulness and an-
swer relevance negatives,, we prompt FLAN-
T5 XXL (discussed in Section 4.1) to gener-
ate a contradictory answer using the few-shot
prompt in Section A.4.
In total,, the number of negatives generated
equals the number of positives generated for eval-
uating context relevance and answer relevance in
RAG systems.
3.2 Preparing LLM Judges
To prepare our RAG evaluation judges,, we use our
synthetic dataset to fine-tune several lightweight
LLMs. We fine-tune our LLM judges to evaluate
the RAG systems across three different capabilities,,
each of which are often analyzed by researchers
and practitioners to gauge RAG system perfor-
mance (Chen et al.,, 2023; James and Es,, 2023):
1.Context Relevance : Is the passage returned
relevant for answering the given query?
2.Answer Faithfulness : Is the answer gener-
ated faithful to the retrieved passage? Or does
it contain hallucinated or extrapolated state-
ments beyond the passage?
3.Answer Relevance : Is the answer generated
relevant given the query and retrieved pas-
sage?",1990b85485c6cba36fdbfb8311c640f7
2024-04-08 02:25:51.044,437986,file:/Workspace/Users/odl_instructor_771155@databrickslabs.com/raw_pdfs/2311.09476.pdf,"Figure 1: Overview of ARES : As inputs,, the ARES pipeline requires an in-domain passage set,, a human preference
validation set of 150 annotated datapoints or more,, and five few-shot examples of in-domain queries and answers,,
which are used for prompting LLMs in synthetic data generation. To prepare our LLM judges for evaluation,, we
first generate synthetic queries and answers from the corpus passages. Using our generated training triples and
a constrastive learning framework,, we fine-tune an LLM to classify query–passage–answer triples across three
criteria: context relevance,, answer faithfulness,, and answer relevance. Finally,, we use the LLM judge to evaluate
RAG systems and generate confidence bounds for the ranking using PPI and the human preference validation set.
For each of the key metrics,, a separate LLM with
a classifier head is fine-tuned to classify positive
and negative examples using a binary classification
training objective. For each concatenated query-
document-answer,, a single LLM judge must clas-
sify the triple as positive or negative for a specific
metric: context relevance,, answer faithfulness,, or
answer relevance. For fine-tuning,, we use our hu-
man preference validation set to evaluate model
improvement after each epoch. We continue fine-
tuning until we have three epochs with no improve-
ment in validation set loss.
3.3 Ranking RAG Systems with Confidence
Intervals
Once we have prepared our LLM judges,, we need
to use them to score and rank the competing RAG
systems. To do this,, ARES samples the in-domain
query-document-answer triples produced by each
RAG approach,, and the judges will label each triple,,
predicting their context relevance,, answer faithful-
ness,, and answer relevance. By averaging the in-
dividual predicted labels for each in-domain triple,,
we calculate the RAG system performance across
each of the three metrics.
In principle,, we could simply report these aver-
age scores as quality metrics for each RAG system.
However,, these scores reflect entirely unlabeled
data with predictions from a synthetically-trained
LLM judge,, and hence may exhibit a degree of
noise. As an extreme alternative,, we could use
just the small human preference validation set dis-
cussed previously for evaluation,, reporting the ex-tent to which each RAG system agrees with (or
deviates from) the human annotations. However,,
an entirely annotation-based evaluation approach
would require labeling outputs from each RAG sys-
tems separately,, which can be costly both in terms
of time and financing.
To combine the benefits of both,, and hence
boost the precision of the evaluation,, ARES uses
prediction-powered inference (PPI) to predict the
system scores. PPI is a recent statistical method
that tightens the confidence interval on the predic-
tions on a small set of annotated datapoints (i.e.,,
our validation set) by leveraging predictions on a
much larger set of non-annotated datapoints. PPI
can leverage both the labeled datapoints and the
ARES judge predictions on the non-annotated dat-
apoints to construct tighter confidence intervals for
our RAG system’s performance.
To do this,, PPI uses the LLM judges on the hu-
man preference validation set to learn a rectifier
function for constructing a confidence set of the
ML model’s performance,, using each ML predic-
tion in the larger non-annotated dataset. The confi-
dence set can then be used to create a tighter confi-
dence interval for the average outcome of the ML
model’s performance (e.g. its context relevance,,
answer faithfulness,, or answer relevance accuracy
individually). By bolstering the human preference
validation set with the much larger set of datapoints
with ML predictions,, PPI can develop reliable con-
fidence intervals for ML model performance that
beat previous classical inference approaches.
The PPI rectifier function allows us to mitigate",4340ec134f10cc93321761a5f3c9e468

dence bounds for the success and failure rates of the
RAG system,, estimating context relevance,, answer
faithfulness,, and answer relevance performances.
Additionally,, PPI allows us to estimate confidence
intervals with a selected level of probability; for our
experiments,, we use a standard 95% alpha (proba-
bility) for our confidence interval.
With the accuracy confidence interval for each
component of the RAG,, we find the midpoint of
each confidence interval and use the midpoints to
rank the RAG systems. With our ranking,, we can
compare different RAG systems,, as well as differ-
ent configurations of the same RAG system,, to find
the optimal approach for a given domain.
4 Experiments
4.1 Models
For our fine-tuned judges,, ARES relies on generat-
ing cheap but quality synthetic queries and answers
using LLMs. For generating our synthetic datasets,,
we use FLAN-T5 XXL (Chung et al.,, 2022). We se-
lected DeBERTa-v3-Large (He et al.,, 2021) for our
fine-tuned LLM judge. Our fine-tuned LLM judges
allows us to rank RAG systems without relying on
external APIs,, solely using few-shot prompts and
deployable LLMs on commercial GPUs.
For our in-context learning baseline,, we use Ope-
nAI’s gpt-3.5-turbo-16k (Brown et al.,, 2020) in a
zero/few-shot setting. For similarity search over
in-domain passages,, we use FAISS IndexFlatL2 for
indexing (Johnson et al.,, 2019) and OpenAI’s text-
embedding-ada-002 for generating embeddings.
We use simlarity search over in-domain passages
to filter our synthetic queries that cannot retrieve
the passage from which they were generated.
4.2 Datasets
Our core experimental goal is to provide a rich pic-
ture of where ARES can be applied effectively.
To test across multiple types of queries,, docu-
ments,, and answers,, we selected all the datasets
from the widely-used KILT and SuperGLUE bench-
marks in which we assess that using RAG systems
is appropriate. From the KILT datasets (Petroni
et al.,, 2021),, we use Natural Questions (NQ),,
HotpotQA,, FEVER,, and Wizards of Wikipedia
(WoW) (Kwiatkowski et al.,, 2019; Yang et al.,,
2018; Akhtar et al.,, 2023; Dinan et al.,, 2018). Each
dataset uses Wikipedia passages but the queries
and answers offer a range of applications. BothNQ and HotpotQA feature direct questions and ex-
pect short answers but NQ uses single passages
for reasoning while HotpotQA requires multiple
passages for reasoning. Furthermore,, FEVER fo-
cuses on fact-verification,, determining if a passage
supports or refutes a given statement,, and expects
an output of ""SUPPORTS"" or ""REFUTES"". WoW
seeks to evaluate dialogue agents by mapping user
dialogue to relevant Wikipedia passages before a
chatbot generates a paragraph-length chat response
incorporating passage knowledge.
From the SuperGLUE datasets (Wang et al.,,
2019),, we use the MultiRC and ReCoRD datasets
(Khashabi et al.,, 2018; Zhang et al.,, 2018). Mul-
tiRC focuses on direct questions for seven different
domains (News,, Wikipedia articles,, articles on so-
ciety/law/justice,, articles on history/anthropology,,
elementary school science textbooks,, 9/11 reports,,
and fiction). ReCoRD focuses on determining the
placeholder entity in a statement,, focusing on news
articles from CNN and the Daily Mail. For Mul-
tiRC and ReCoRD,, we create open-domain ver-
sions of their tasks. For MultiRC,, we perform re-
trieval over its seven sets of domain passages while
for ReCoRD,, we perform retrieval over its news
article passages.
The efficacy of ARES relies on its ability to rank
different RAG systems while only using a human
preference validation set and a domain-targeted
LLM judge. To test the limits of ARES,, we need
to simulate the existence of many RAG systems
that are separated by small accuracy margins on
our evaluation metrics. To generate mock RAG
systems,, we create their artificial query-passage-
answer triples,, in which we empirically know the
positive and negative examples of the mock RAG
system. We generate these mock splits of the given
datasets by selecting:
•The positive and negative query-passage
matches for context relevance
•The positive and negative query-passage-
answer matches for answer relevance
For our positive query-passage-answer triples,,
we can simply use the KILT and SuperGLUE ex-
amples without any alteration. For gathering nega-
tive query-passage pairs and query-passage-answer
triples,, we randomly sample passages and answers
from either: the same Wikipedia document or an en-
tirely random Wikipedia document. This sampling
allows us to artificially create mock RAG systems",0ce42142ffd1cc09983a95250e85149a
2024-04-08 02:25:51.044,437986,file:/Workspace/Users/odl_instructor_771155@databrickslabs.com/raw_pdfs/2311.09476.pdf,"for testing ARES. By sampling both related and
unrelated documents/answers,, we hope to better
gauge the efficacy of ARES in judging RAG out-
puts. We include examples of our evaluation set in
A.6.
We do not evaluate answer faithfulness for KILT
and SuperGLUE datasets since we do not have
human-annotated hallucinated answers to use for
evaluation. However,, the ARES framework and
code base allow for answer faithfulness evaluation
as well.
Using the validation subsets for each KILT
and SuperGLUE dataset,, we create nine different
dataset splits,, ranging from 70% success rate to
90% success rate for each of the evaluated RAG
criteria; each dataset is separated by 2.5% accuracy
points (e.g. 70.0%,, 72.5%,, 75.0%,, . . . ,, 90.0%).
Each split also represents a different mock RAG
system. Since we know the success percentages of
each dataset split,, we know the appropriate rank-
ing of each mock RAG system. This allows us to
test ARES success at both scoring and ranking the
mock RAG systems appropriately across the three
evaluation criteria.
4.3 Metrics
To calculate the correlation between the correct
ranking and the ARES ranking,, we use the Kendall
rank correlation coefficient or Kendall’s tau:
τ=(#of concordant pairs )−(#of discordant pairs )
#of pairs total
(1)
Concordant pairs are defined as two ordinal val-
ues in the ranking where the earlier value in the
sequence is lower than the later value in the se-
quence. Discordant pairs are defined as two ordinal
values in the ranking where the earlier value in
the sequence is greater than the later value in the
sequence.
In development,, researchers and engineers
will be comparing different RAG configurations
through individual pairwise comparisons of model
choices,, retriever selection,, and document prepro-
cessing. We want to make sure that ARES has sat-
isfactory accuracy in pairwise comparisons across
a variety of performance gaps between RAG sys-
tems. Kendall’s tau is explicitly designed for mea-
suring the accuracy of such pairwise comparisons,,
calculating the correlation between a perfectly ac-
curate pairwise ranking and an experimental pair-
wise ranking. As a result,, Kendall’s tau remainsa popular and widespread metric used in informa-
tion retrieval,, allowing developers to evaluate rank-
ing systems empirically. Therefore,, we believe
Kendall’s tau and micro-F1 (prediction accuracy)
provide meaningful metrics for testing the efficacy
of ARES as a RAG evaluation system.
5 Results & Analysis
5.1 ARES Ranking
Our goal is to explore whether ARES is more effec-
tive at scoring and ranking RAG systems than the
current popular automated RAG evaluation system,,
RAGAS (James and Es,, 2023). In Table 1,, we also
evaluate a few-shot prompted GPT-3.5 judge. We
compare RAGAS and the few-shot judge against
ARES,, which as discussed before uses syntheti-
cally fine-tuned LLM (DeBERTa-v3-Large). For
the few-shot GPT-3.5 judge,, we provide few-shot
examples for guiding predictions; the prompts are
included in Appendices A.1,, A.2,, and A.3. For
both ARES and the GPT-3.5 judge baseline,, we
augment the LLM with PPI,, using a 300-datapoint
human preference validation set to rectify the ML
predictions and produce confidence intervals for
scoring.
Across almost all settings across the datasets
from KILT and SuperGLUE (i.e.,, NQ,, HotpotQA,,
WoW,, FEVER,, MultiRC,, and ReCoRD),, ARES
provides a more accurate ranking of RAG sys-
tems than RAGAS. ARES averages a Kendall’s
tau0.065 higher for context relevance and0.132
higher for answer relevance than RAGAS . Addi-
tionally,, the LLM-judge is substantially more accu-
rate than RAGAS at predicting context relevance
and answer relevance of a query-passage-answer
triple. For context relevance,, ARES with a fine-
tuned LLM-judge is 59.9 percentage points higher
than RAGAS while for answer relevance,, our sys-
tem is 14.4 percentage points higher than RAGAS .
Overall,, ARES provides a more accurate system for
automatically evaluating RAG configurations than
RAGAS by leveraging domain-adaptive techniques
for prompting and training as well as utilizing PPI
to bolster model predictions.
Furthermore,, ARES provides a more accurate
ranking of the RAG systems than the GPT-3.5
judge,, averaging a Kendall’s tau 0.06 higher over
both context relevance and answer relevance. Be-
tween the judge configurations,, the fine-tuned LLM
judge of ARES can more precisely distinguish be-
tween RAG systems and guide configuration de-",9af38ef9f477a0c530b0327933c08bc8

Table 1: ARES Ranking with Fine-tuned LLM Judges vs. RAGAS and GPT-3.5 Judge : For scoring context
relevance and answer relevance (C.R. and A.R. in the table,, respectively),, we compare ARES with our fine-tuned
LLM judges to RAGAS,, the automated RAG scoring framework,, and a few-shot GPT-3.5 judge. RAGAS also uses
GPT-3.5 as its judge but it uses few-shot prompts that are not targeted for each evaluation domain. Overall,, we
found that ARES ranked RAG systems more accurately than RAGAS and GPT-3.5 across all the explored datasets.
The Kendall’s tau for ARES was 0.065 higher on average for scoring context relevance and0.132 higher on average
for scoring answer relevance than RAGAS. We selected GPT-3.5 instead of GPT-4 due to the high financial costs of
running GPT-4 over the tens of thousands of queries,, documents,, and answers for each dataset; the lower financial
costs required to run. For PPI in both ARES and the GPT-3.5 judge,, we used 300 human annotations for our human
preference validation set. The prompts used for the GPT-3.5 judges are included in Sections A.1,, A.2,, and A.3.
cisions surrounding document splitting,, retriever
selection,, and generative LLM choice. However,,
while the fine-tuned LLM judge had a higher
Kendall’s tau on average,, the GPT-3.5 judge is
more readily deployable and does not require any
additional fine-tuning. The GPT-3.5 judge does
come with its own querying costs,, which can vary
based on the date of querying as well as the total
tokens used in evaluation.
5.2 Limits of PPI
Prediction-powered inference (PPI) relies on a hu-
man preference validation set for calculating its
rectifier function ,, which allows it to gauge the pre-
diction error of the ARES LLM judge and generate
tighter confidence intervals for estimated RAG per-
formance (see subsection 3.3 for more information
on PPI). Additional labeled datapoints tightens the
confidence interval of PPI: the more labeled dat-
apoints,, the more accurate PPI is in calculating
the rectifier function. We wanted to explore just
how little human annotations are needed for PPI,,
and thus ARES,, to be effective at comparing RAG
configurations.
In Table 2,, we analyze the efficacy of ARES
with different labeled datapoint counts for PPI. ForKendall’s Tau by Dataset

meaningfully distinguish between the alternate RAG

and answer relevance (C.R. and A.R.,, respectively).",e8825fe982f7fd190ad828a307d7f280
2024-04-08 02:25:51.044,437986,file:/Workspace/Users/odl_instructor_771155@databrickslabs.com/raw_pdfs/2311.09476.pdf,"NQ,, MultiRC,, and ReCoRD,, we found that the
Kendall’s tau for ARES drops below 0.75 on aver-
age when using less than 100 datapoints for con-
text relevance and answer relevance categorization.
We found the same pattern over the broader set of
datasets explored,, regardless of query,, document,,
or answer type. Therefore,, we recommend using
ARES with a sufficient human preference valida-
tion set for PPI (e.g. a set greater than 150-200
datapoints).
5.3 Strengths and Limits of Cross-Domain
Applications
The generalizability of the LLM judge used in
ARES is critical for deploying our framework in
specialized domains,, particularly domains where
in-domain queries,, documents,, and answers are dif-
ficult to gather. Therefore,, we wanted to test how
the LLM judges used in ARES would be affected
by three domain shifts:
1.Change in query type from training to test (e.g.
switch from questions to statements) by using
a judge fine-tuned for NQ to evaluate RAG
systems on FEVER and vice-versa.
2.Change in document type from training to test
(e.g. switch from Wikipedia passages to news
articles) by using a judge fine-tuned for NQ to
evaluate RAG systems on MultiRC and vice-
versa.
3.Change in both query and document type from
training to test (e.g. switch from Wikipedia-
based QA dataset to news article-based state-
ment dataset) by using a judge fine-tuned for
NQ to evaluate RAG systems on ReCoRD and
vice-versa.
In Table 3,, we found that the fine-tuned LLM
judges used in ARES proved successful in cross-
domain applications. Across all settings,, we found
that LLM judges in ARES had strong generaliz-
ability,, even when only using 300 datapoints in our
human preference validation set for PPI. Further-
more,, we found that even when the LLM judge’s ac-
curacy suffered in cross-domain applications,, PPI
helped mitigate the loss in accuracy and still allow
ARES to be successful. Additional examples for
PPI also continued to boost cross-domain ARES
performance in subsequent tests.
While LLM judges in ARES were successful
in cross-domain applications for KILT and Super-GLUE,, LLM judges are unable to generalize when
making more drastic shifts in domain,, such as:
•Switching languages (e.g. English to Spanish,,
German,, and other languages)
•Switching from text to code (e.g. questions
+ passages to coding functions + documenta-
tion)
•Switching from retrieving text to extraction of
entities,, webpages,, or citations
To test cross-lingual transfer,, we used the
XGLUE datasets (Liang et al.,, 2020); a LLM judge
fine-tuned on NQ achieved a Kendall’s tau of 0.33
over both context relevance and answer relevance
scoring for XGLUE. To test text-to-code,, we used
CodeSearchNet (Husain et al.,, 2019); an LLM
judge fine-tuned on NQ achieved a Kendall’s tau
of 0.28 over both context relevance and answer
relevance scoring for CodeSearchNet. To test ex-
traction task generalizability,, we used T-Rex from
KILT (Elsahar et al.,, 2018; Petroni et al.,, 2021); an
LLM judge fine-tuned on NQ achieved a Kendall’s
tau of 0.38 over both context relevance and answer
relevance scoring for T-Rex. Each of these cross-
domain shifts require in-domain passages and few-
shot query examples for reconfiguring LLM judges
in ARES.
5.4 GPT-4 for Human-Labeling
ARES relies on human-annotations for utilizing
PPI alongside the LLM judge. However,, we wanted
to test if GPT-4 generated labels could replace the
human preference validation set altogether,, allow-
ing us to solely rely on few-shot examples for gen-
erating context relevance,, answer faithfulness,, and
answer relevance annotations needed for PPI.
In Table 4,, we explored if GPT-4 labels could
replace human labels entirely,, allowing us to only
need human annotations for few-shot examples.
Since GPT-4 labels could be generated relatively
cheaply,, we created 500 labels for each of our ex-
plored datasets (e.g. NQ,, FEVER,, and MultiRC).
In ARES,, we found GPT-4 generated labels are
not as useful as human labels,, leading to a drop in
Kendall’s tau by 0.05 to 0.3 across most settings.
However,, additional generation of GPT-4 could
continue to tighten the gap in performance between
machine and human annotations by tightening the

Table 3: Cross-Domain Usage of Fine-tuned LLM Judges : We tested the cross-domain application of the
fine-tuned LLM judge in the ARES framework. We found that for both context relevance and answer relevance
(C.R. and A.R. in the table,, respectively),, fine-tuned LLM judges showed strong generalizability across domains
when changing query type (e.g. NQ and FEVER),, document type (e.g. NQ and MultiRC),, or both (e.g. NQ and
ReCoRD). For PPI,, we used 300 labeled examples for our human preference validation set but also found that
additional examples further improved the performance of ARES. Furthermore,, we found that even in scenarios
where the fine-tuned LLM judge’s accuracy significantly dropped out-of-domain (e.g. answer relevance for NQ
to FEVER),, PPI mitigated the decrease in judge performance. In the table,, we define PPI range as the number of
percentage points from the lower bound to the upper bound of the PPI confidence interval.

Table 4: GPT-4 Labels vs. Human Labels : We wanted to explore the practicality of using GPT-4 generated
labels instead of human annotations for our human preference validation set in ARES. In the experiments,, we
generated 500 GPT-4 labels as replacements for human labeling using few-shot prompts (see Sections A.1,, A.2,,
and A.3). While GPT-4 generated labels decreased Kendall’s tau in most settings by 0.05 to 0.30,, the ability to
cheaply produce GPT-4 generated labels significantly reduces the cost of annotation,, cutting it from hundreds of
annotations to less than ten for few-shot prompts. Additionally,, the efficacy of PPI continues improving as we
generate more GPT-4 generated labels. In the table,, we define PPI range as the number of percentage points from
the lower number to the upper number of the PPI confidence bounding. Additionally,, we use the fine-tuned LLM

6 Future Work
Our experimental results with ARES inspired sev-
eral new directions for future research:
•Improved generation of GPT-4 labels as a re-
placement for human labeling in ARES
•Creating more robust techniques for synthetic
datasets used in fine-tuning lightweight LLM
judges
•Developing a foundation model for RAG eval-
uation to use as a starting checkpoint for the
fine-tuned LLM judge in ARES
•Utilizing logits in LLM judge prediction to
improve PPI confidence intervals
•Testing more sophisticated LLMs as fine-
tuned judge for ARES
7 Conclusion
In this work,, we present ARES,, a novel automated
evaluation framework for retrieval-augmented gen-
eration (RAG) that specializes to the evaluation
domain. ARES offers a novel training pipeline for
fine-tuning lightweight LLM judges on syntheti-
cally generated queries and answers. With its LLM
judges,, ARES can evaluate each component of a
RAG system separately to help improve system
understanding and create targeted solutions. Addi-
tionally,, PPI allows ARES to improve the precision
and accuracy of the LLM judge’s scoring by com-
bining high-quality ML predictions with a human
preference validation set. By combining PPI with
the specialized LLM judge,, ARES evaluates RAG
systems with minimal human annotations for eval-
uation. For the six different datasets in KILT and
SuperGLUE requiring RAG-based solutions,, we
found that ARES can accurately score and rank
RAG systems based on context relevance,, answer
faithfulness,, and answer relevance scores,, beating
the existing RAGAS automated evaluation frame-
work. Finally,, we discuss several avenues for future
work building on our experiments with ARES.References

Abstract
Chaining language model (LM) calls as com-
posable modules is fueling a new way of pro-
gramming,, but ensuring LMs adhere to important
constraints requires heuristic “prompt engineer-
ing.” We introduce LM Assertions ,, a program-
ming construct for expressing computational con-
straints that LMs should satisfy. We integrate our
constructs into the recent DSPy programming
model for LMs and present new strategies that
allow DSPy to compile programs with LM As-
sertions into more reliable and accurate systems.
We also propose strategies to use assertions at in-
ference time for automatic self-reﬁnement with
LMs. We report on four diverse case studies for
text generation and ﬁnd that LM Assertions im-
prove not only compliance with imposed rules
but also downstream task performance,, passing
constraints up to 164% more often and generat-
ing up to 37% more higher-quality responses.
1. Introduction
Language models (LMs) now power various applications,,
from conversational agents to writing assistants. However ,,
the probabilistic nature of LMs often results in outputs
that may not align with the constraints of the domain or
the larger pipeline in which the LM is used. To address
this,, researchers have explored various techniques,, inclu d-
ing applying constrained decoding ( Hokamp & Liu ,,2017 ;
Hu et al. ,,2019 ),, exploring approaches for self-reﬂection
and tree search ( Madaan et al. ,,2023 ;Shinn et al. ,,2023 ;
Yao et al. ,,2023 ),, building domain-speciﬁc languages and
like LMQL ( Beurer-Kellner et al. ,,2023 ),, or monitoring
models with assertions and guardrails ( Kang et al. ,,2020 ;
Rebedea et al. ,,2023 ) to steer LMs towards more control-
lable outputs.
Recently,, several LM frameworks like LangChain ( Chase ,,
2022 ) and DSPy ( Khattab et al. ,,2022 ;2024 ) provide devel-
opers with interfaces to build complex LM pipelines. Some
offer several features to control LM outputs,, e.g.,, DSPy canoptimize multi-stage prompts to maximize a target metric.
However,, they cannot take arbitrary computational con-
straints on LM pipelines to either teach the LM to follow
such constraints and/or to introspectively self-reﬁne out-
puts. While some of this may be achieved via pain-staking
“prompt engineering” or other ad-hoc guidance strategies,,
such efforts are labor-intensive and conﬂate the high-leve l
design of new AI systems with the low-level exploration of
teaching LMs how to follow constraints.
We propose LM Assertions ,, a novel programming construct
designed to enforce user-speciﬁed properties on LM out-
puts within a pipeline. Drawing inspiration from runtime
assertions and program speciﬁcations in traditional pro-
gramming,, LM Assertions are expressed as boolean con-
ditions that express the desired characteristics of LM out-
puts. We integrate LM Assertions into the recent DSPy pro-
gramming model. Besides serving as conventional runtime
monitors,, LM Assertions enable multiple novel assertion-
driven optimizations to improve LM programs.
Assertion-driven backtracking. LM Assertions can facil-
itate runtime self-reﬁnement in LM pipelines at inference
time. When a constraint fails,, we allow the pipeline to back-
track and retry the failing module. LM Assertions provide
feedback on retry attempts; they inject erring outputs and
error messages to the prompt to introspectively self-reﬁne
outputs. Figure 1illustrates this within a DSPy pipeline.
Assertion-driven example bootstrapping. LM Asser-
tions can enable guided prompt optimizers at compile time.
Integrated with existing automatic prompt optimizers in
DSPy,, they can enable generating harder few-shot exam-
ples,, which can teach LM programs to conduct challenging
steps.
Counterexample bootstrapping. During prompt opti-
mization and example bootstrapping,, another important
contribution of LM Assertions is to develop demonstrations
that contain failed examples and traces to ﬁx the errors.
When the counterexamples are mixed with bootstrapped
few-shot examples,, the LM is more likely to avoid the same
mistakes without assertion-driven backtracking.

Figure 1. DSPy program with LM Assertions for multi-hop question-ans wering task with a retriever. We introduce two soft assertio ns
(suggestions): (1) query to retriever should be less than 10 0 characters; (2) query to retriever should differ from prev ious queries. For
instance,, if the second suggestion fails,, DSPy will constru ct a new prompt to retry the generate _query module with additional ﬁelds,,
highlighting the previously generated query and a user-deﬁ ned error message to help the LM reﬁne its generation.
We propose two types of LM Assertions: (hard) Assertions
and (soft) Suggestions ,, denoted by Assert andSuggest ,,
respectively. Hard assertions represent critical conditi ons
that,, when violated after a maximum number of retries,,
cause the LM pipeline to halt,, signaling a non-negotiable
breach of requirements. On the other hand,, suggestions de-
note desirable but non-essential properties; their violat ion
triggers the self-reﬁnement process,, but exceeding a maxi-
mum number of retries does not halt the pipeline. Instead,,
the pipeline continues to execute the next module.
We implement our work atop DSPy,, a state-of-the-art
framework for building and automatically optimizing
declarative LM pipelines. The integration enables us to
design and implement our three new assertion-driven op-
timizations . It enables DSPy programs to self-reﬁne and
produce outputs that adhere to speciﬁc guidelines. It simpl i-
ﬁes debugging,, providing developers a clearer understand-
ing of LM behavior in complex pipelines. In addition,, by
combining LM Assertions with prompt optimizers in DSPy,,
we can bootstrap better few-shot examples and counterex-
amples to assertions to make the pipeline more robust and
performant.
We evaluate the effectiveness of LM Assertions on four
varied knowledge-intensive tasks: multihop question an-
swering (MultiHopQA),, long format question answering
(LongFormQA),, formatted quiz generation (QuizGen),, and
valid tweet generation (TweetGen). Our experiments show
that LM Assertions and assertion-driven backtracking sig-
niﬁcantly improve LM programs from generating 37.6%
well-formatted quizzes in JSON to 98.8% in QuizGen.Then,, with assertion-driven example bootstrapping and
counterexample bootstrapping,, we see an increase from
2.0% to 73.0% in writing more engaging tweets in Tweet-
Gen and a consistent boost on almost all other assertion
metrics. Finally,, with LM Assertions and all assertion-
driven optimizations,, we see a maximum gain from 30.5%
to 87.2% in generating valid quiz questions.
Our contributions are,, ﬁrst,, introducing LM Assertions as
an abstraction for language model programming. Then,,
we present three novel optimizations for LM pipelines:
assertion-driven backtracking during inference to help
models self-reﬁne,, assertion-driven example bootstrap-
ping to generate and choose more effective few-shot exam-
ples,, and counterexample bootstrapping to develop few-
shot examples with erroneous results and corresponding
ﬁxes to help the model become more reliable at complying
to developer-desired constraints.
2. Background and Motivation
The goals of LM Assertions are general and can be applied
to any LM program. Due to its modular paradigm,, ﬂexibil-
ity,, and extensibility,, we implement our work as extensions
to the state-of-the-art DSPy ( Khattab et al. ,,2024 ) frame-
work. Below,, we brieﬂy describe the DSPy programming
model for building declarative LM pipelines and compiling
them into auto-optimized prompt (or ﬁnetune) chains. We
then sketch a realistic,, motivating example for LM Asser-
tions and show their usefulness for self-reﬁnement in LM
pipelines.

2.1. The DSPy Programming model
DSPy is a framework for programmatically solving ad-
vanced tasks with language and retrieval models through
composing and declaring modules. The overarching goal of
DSPy is to replace brittle “prompt engineering” tricks with
composable modules and automatic (typically discrete) op-
timizers.
First,, instead of free-form string prompts,, a DSPy program-
mer will deﬁne a signature to specify what an LM needs to
do declaratively. For instance,, a module may need to con-
sume a question and return an answer,, as shown below:
qa =dspy.Predict( ""question -> answer"" )
qa(question= ""Where is the Eiffel tower?"" )
# Output: The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris,, France.
To use a signature,, the programmer declares a module with
that signature,, like we deﬁned a Predict module above.
The core module for working with signatures in DSPy is
Predict . Internally,, it stores the supplied signature. When
the signature is called,, like a function,, it constructs a for -
matted prompt according to the signature’s inputs and out-
puts. Then,, it calls an LM with a list of demonstrations (if
any) following this format for prompting.
DSPy modules usually call dspy.Predict one or more
times. They generally encapsulate prompting techniques,,
turning them into modular functions that support any
signature. This contrasts with handwriting task-speciﬁc
prompts with manually tuned instructions or few-shot ex-
amples. Consider,, for example,, the below DSPy module
from Khattab et al. (2024 ),, which implements the popular
“chain-of-thought” prompting technique ( Wei et al. ,,2022 ).
classChainOfThought( dspy.Module):
def__init__(self,, signature):
rationale _field = dspy.OutputField(
prefix=""Reasoning: Think step by step."" )
signature = dspy.Signature(signature).
prepend_output_field(rationale _field)
self.predict = dspy.Predict(signature)
defforward(self,, **kwargs):
returnself.predict( **kwargs)
DSPy modules can be composed in arbitrary pipelines
by ﬁrst declaring the modules needed at initialization
and then expressing the pipeline with arbitrary code that
calls the modules in a forward method (as shown in the
ChainOfThought module above and the MultiHopQA program
in Section 2.2). Finally,, DSPy provides optimizers that au-
tomates generating good quality demonstrations (few-shot
examples) or instructions for a task given a metric to opti-
mize. We may also refer to the few-shot example selection
process as compiling the LM pipeline application.
Challenges. DSPy signatures provide type hints that softlyshape LM’s behavior. However,, the framework currently
lacks constructs developers can use to specify arbitrary
computational constraints the pipeline must satisfy. Addi-
tionally,, one can imagine the LM pipeline using these con-
straints to reﬁne its outputs and to teach the LM to respect
these speciﬁcations at compile time.
To address these challenges,, we integrate LM Assertions
as ﬁrst-class primitives in DSPy. In the style of Pythonic
assertions,, they are intuitive constructs that allow DSPy
to constrain LM outputs. They are ﬂexible in that they
can be strict restrictions,, softer guidelines for backtrac king
and self-correction of LM calls,, or simple debugging state-
ments. In what follows,, we describe a motivating example
of a DSPy program that uses LM Assertions for multi-hop
question answering.
2.2. Motivating Example
Aiden is a developer building an LM pipeline for multi-hop
question-answering. The task involves the LM performing
a series of inferential steps (multi-hop) before answering a
question while utilizing a retriever to get relevant contex t.
In a simple DSPy implementation,, Aiden may design the
pipeline below,, where the LM generates search queries to
collect relevant context and aggregate them to generate the
answer.1
classMultiHopQA( dspy.Module):
def__init__(self):
self.retrieve = dspy.Retrieve(k=3)
self.gen _query = dspy.ChainOfThought( ""context,,question -> query"" )
self.gen _answer = dspy.ChainOfThought( ""context,,question -> answer"" )
defforward(self,, question):
context = []
forhopin range (2):
query = self.gen _query(context=context,, question=question).query
context += self.retrieve(query).passages
returnself.gen _answer(context=context,, question=question)
However,, certain issues with the pipeline might affect its
performance. For instance,, since questions are complex,,
the generated search query could be long and imprecise,,
resulting in irrelevant retrieved context. Another issue i s
that similar multi-hop queries would result in redundant re -
trieved context. One might observe that these are propertie s
of generated queries that are computationally checkable
and,, if expressible as constraints on the pipeline,, might im-
prove its performance.
Figure 1shows a DSPy program with LM Assertions for
this task. To mitigate the issues above,, Aiden introduces
two soft LM Assertions: ﬁrst,, they restrict the length of

It captures the key computations in popular multi-hop quest ion-
answering systems such as Baleen ( Khattab et al. ,,2021 ) and IR-
CoT ( Trivedi et al. ,,2022 ).

the query to be less than 100 characters,, aiming for precise
information retrieval. Second,, they require the query gen-
erated at each hop to be dissimilar from previous hops,, dis-
couraging retrieval of redundant information. They specif y
these as soft constraints using the Suggest construct. The
force of this construct is to allow the pipeline to backtrack
to the failing module and try again. On retrying,, the LM
prompt also contains its past attempts and suggestion mes-
sages,, enabling constraint-guided self-reﬁnement.
In Section 5,, we evaluate this pipeline on the Hot-
PotQA ( Yang et al. ,,2018 ) dataset. We ﬁnd that enabling
the developer to express two simple suggestions improves
the retriever’s recall (by 6.5%–7.9%) and the accuracy of
generated answers (by 3.4%–14.4%).
3. Semantics of LM Assertions
To help with the goals mentioned above,, in this work,, we
introduce LM Assertions and integrate them in DSPy. We
deﬁne LM Assertions as programmatic elements that dic-
tate certain conditions or rules that must be adhered to dur-
ing the execution of an LM pipeline. These constraints
ensure that the pipeline’s behavior aligns with developer-
speciﬁed invariants or guidelines,, enhancing the reliabil ity,,
predictability,, and correctness of the pipeline’s output.
We categorize LM Assertions into two well-deﬁned pro-
gramming constructs,, namely Assertions andSuggestions ,,
denoted by the constructs Assert andSuggest . They
are constructs that enforce constraints and guide an LM
pipeline’s execution ﬂow.
Delineating Assert from Conventional Assertions. The
conventional assert statement,, built into most program-
ming languages,, is a debugging aid that checks a con-
dition and,, if the condition evaluates to false,, raises an
AssertionError exception,, typically terminating the pro-
gram execution. In contrast,, our Assert construct offers
a sophisticated retry mechanism while supporting several
new optimizations. On an Assert failing,, the pipeline tran-
sitions to a special retry state ,, allowing it to reattempt
a failing LM call while being aware of its previous at-
tempts and the error message raised. If,, after a maxi-
mum number of self-reﬁnement attempts,, the assertion still
fails,, the pipeline transitions to an error state and raises
anAssertionError ,, terminating the pipeline. This enables
Assert to be much more powerful than conventional assert
statements,, leveraging the LM to conduct retries and adjust -
ments before concluding that an error is irrecoverable.
Delineating Suggest fromAssert .In contrast to our Assert
statements,, our Suggest statements are softer constraints
that recommend but do not mandate conditions that may
guide the LM pipeline toward desired domain-speciﬁc out-
comes. When a Suggest condition is not met,, like Assert,, the pipeline enters the special retry state,, allowing reat -
tempts of the failing LM call and self-reﬁnement. How-
ever,, if the suggestion fails after a maximum number of
self-reﬁnement attempts,, the pipeline simply logs a warn-
ingSuggestionError message and continues execution. This
allows the pipeline to adjust its behavior in response to the
suggestion while being ﬂexible and resilient to suboptimal
states (or sub-optimal or heuristic computational checks) .
In the following sections,, we deﬁne the default backtrack-
ing semantics of these constructs more formally. However,,
we provide the opportunity to extend custom semantics for
bothAssert andSuggest (Appendix A.2).
3.1. Semantics of Assert
TheAssert construct enforces invariants within the LM
pipeline. The semantics of an assertion can be deﬁned in
terms of a state transition system by adapting big-step oper -
ational semantics notations in ( Kahn ,,1987 ) whereσrrepre-
sents the pipeline’s state,, and the subscript rrepresents the
current retry count within the state σ. The maximum num-
ber of retries allowed per assertion is denoted by R. The
transition relation σr⊢i→σ′reads as “under the state σr,,
the instruction itransitions the state to σ′”. Now,, we deﬁne
a simpliﬁed semantics for Assert :
σr⊢Assert(e,,m)→σ′
0if eval(σ,,e) =true
σr⊢Assert(e,,m)→σr+1 if eval(σ,,e) =false and r < R
σr⊢Assert(e,,m)→σ⊥if eval(σ,,e) =false and r≥R
Here,, eval (σ,,e)denotes the evaluation of expression ein
stateσ. Ifeevaluates to true,, the pipeline transitions to
a new state σ′and continues execution. If eevaluates to
false and the current retry count ris less than the maxi-
mum allowed retries R,, the pipeline transitions to a retry
stateσr+1. Here,, the pipeline attempts to recover or ad-
just its behavior,, incrementing the retry count rby one. If
the assertion continues to fail and the retry count reaches
R,, the pipeline transitions to an error state σ⊥,, and an
AssertionError with message mis raised,, halting the exe-
cution.
3.2. Semantics of Suggest
TheSuggest construct provides non-binding guidance to the
LM pipeline. Similar to Assert ,, its semantics can be deﬁned
as follows:
4",fb2654a10992cebfc5539f27f9fd8687
2024-04-08 02:25:51.043,262119,file:/Workspace/Users/odl_instructor_771155@databrickslabs.com/raw_pdfs/2312.13382.pdf,"DSPy Assertions: Computational Constraints for Self-Reﬁn ing Language Model Pipelines
σr⊢Suggest(e,,m)→σ′
0if eval(σ,,e) =true
σr⊢Suggest(e,,m)→σr+1 if eval(σ,,e) =false and r < R
σr⊢Suggest(e,,m)→σ′′
0if eval(σ,,e) =false and r≥R
If the expression eevaluates to true,, the pipeline transitions
to a new state σ′and continues execution. If eevaluates
to false and the current retry count rdoes not exceed the
maximum retries R,, the pipeline attempts to recover or ad-
just its behavior in a retry state σr+1. However,, different
fromAssert ,, if the suggestion continues to fail and the retry
countrreachesR,, the pipeline transitions to a new state
σ′′where it resets the retry count,, logs the message mas
a warning of a SuggestionError that could not be resolved,,
and continues executing the next pipeline module.
4. Assertion-Driven Optimizations
4.1. Assertion-Driven Backtracking
BothAssert andSuggest allow the pipeline to retry a failing
LM call and self-reﬁne its outputs in a special retry state.
One might observe that this involves dynamically altering
the control ﬂow of the LM pipeline during execution. On
passing assertions and suggestions,, the control ﬂows typi-
cally into the next LM pipeline module.
To handle assertion failures,, the LM pipeline may utilize
an error handler that determines the next instruction to exe -
cute. The handler takes the current erring state σand the er-
ror message mas inputs and returns a new state. In the new
state,, control ﬂows as described in Section 3.1and3.2. For
bothAssert andSuggest ,, if the maximum retry attempts are
not surpassed,, the handler yields the control to the failing
LM module with an updated prompt that includes past fail-
ing outputs and instructions. However,, upon exceeding the
maximum retries,, the handler halts the execution for a fail-
ingAssert or progresses to the next module in the pipeline
for aSuggest .
In Appendix A,, we describe the implementation of these
constructs and handlers in DSPy. Our implementation is
publicly available and has been integrated into the DSPy
framework.
4.2. Assertion-Driven Example Bootstrapping
LM Assertions can be useful in optimizing the prompts as
well. One optimizer BootstrapFewShot in DSPy employs a
teacher-student method to use the teacher model to boot-
strap representative few-shot demonstrations for the stu-
dent model for the same program. During the bootstrap-
ping step,, the teacher model can utilize LM Assertions asextra ﬁlters to bootstrap more robust examples.
Based on our observation,, in some cases,, the naïve opti-
mizer in DSPy would bootstrap an example with the correct
ﬁnal response while the intermediate module outputs are in-
correct,, which leads to wrong demos for intermediate LM
modules. To enable assertion-driven example bootstrap-
ping,, we apply assertion-driven backtracking to the teache r
model in the BootstrapFewShot optimizer. In this way,, all
the bootstrapped demonstrations are guaranteed to follow
the intermediate constraints,, too. In this way,, although th e
prompt optimizer only has the metric for the ﬁnal answer,,
the examples selected will have higher qualities for all in-
termediate modules thanks to LM Assertions.
4.3. Counterexample Bootstrapping
When integrating LM Assertions and assertion-driven back-
tracking in the teacher model of a prompt optimizer,, we can
collect traces where the language model fails certain asser -
tions.
The optimizer in DSPy is able to incorporate feedback from
the erroneous examples during backtracking as demonstra-
tions. The usage of counterexample is twofold. First,, coun-
terexamples serve as negative demonstrations in the few-
shot learning prompt,, guiding models to avoid making sim-
ilar mistakes. Second,, with assertion-driven backtrackin g,,
counterexample traces often come with the demonstrations
of ﬁxing particular LM Assertion failures. These demon-
strations are helpful for the student model to achieve a
much higher rate of passing the underlying constraints even
without LM Assertions and assertion-drive backtracking.
Overall,, with counterexample bootstrapping only,, the over -
head of backtracking and self-reﬁnement for the student
model is completely eliminated while the program still
has the ability to generate more responses that adhere to
programmer-deﬁned assertions.
5. Evaluation
5.1. Tasks & Metrics
We study various aspects of LM Assertions on 4interesting
variants of the popular HotPotQA ( Yang et al. ,,2018 ) task:
T1MultiHopQA : A complex question-answering task in-
volving generating multi-hop search queries for ques-
tions and using the retrieved context to generate the
correct answer.
T2LongFormQA : A more demanding question-
answering task,, where the generated answer must
contain citations that are faithful to the retrieved
context information.
T3TweetGen : A variant of HotPotQA,, where the gener-

ated answer is expected to be a concise and engaging
“tweet” that is also faithful to the retrieved context.
T4QuizGen : A task involving generating candidate an-
swer choices for HotPotQA questions in a JSON format,,
with distractor choices and the correct answer.
Each task is evaluated with two metric categories:
•Intrinsic Quality measures the degree to which
the outputs conform to the LM Assertions speciﬁed
within the program. This metric is a benchmark for
the system’s ability to pass internal validation checks.
•Extrinsic Quality measures how LM Assertions af-
fect downstream performance,, often on task-speciﬁc
properties we cannot assert directly without access to
ground-truth labels. Here,, assertions provide guidance
that indirectly inﬂuences overall performance.
These two metrics will respectively enable us to investi-
gate the hypotheses that LM Assertions can facilitate self-
correction and reﬁnement in LM pipelines ( H1) and that
such guided self-reﬁnement can enhance the performance
of downstream applications ( H2).
We provide a more comprehensive overview of the ad-
vanced tasks LongFormQA (Appendix B.1),, QuizGen (Ap-
pendix B.2) and TweetGen (Appendix B.3),, evaluated met-
rics,, and applied constraints in Appendix B.
5.2. Dataset and Models
We utilize the HotPotQA ( Yang et al. ,,2018 ) dataset for
each task in the open-domain “fullwiki” setting. We then
partition the ofﬁcial training set into subsets: 70% for tra in-
ing and 30% for validation. We only focus on examples la-
beled as “hard” within the dataset to align with the criteria
marked by the ofﬁcial validation and test sets. For training
and development sets,, we sample 300 examples each. We
sample 500 examples for testing.
We use the ofﬁcial Wikipedia 2017 “abstracts” dump of
HotPotQA using a ColBERTv2 ( Santhanam et al. ,,2021 )
retriever for retrieval. We test the program using Ope-
nAI’sgpt-3.5-turbo (Brown et al. ,,2020 ) withmax_tokens
=500 andtemperature=0.7 for our experimental setup.
5.3. Strategies
Table 1summarizes the ﬁve strategies in which LM As-
sertions (particularly Suggest ) can be utilized for each
task. First,, we distinguish uncompiled strategies (i.e.,, zero-
shot) that predict responses directly from compiled strate-
gies (i.e.,, few-shot) that contain demonstrations crafted
by the DSPy compiler ( Khattab et al. ,,2024 ) using itsAssertion

piled setting,, we differentiate student and teacher module s,,
with the teacher compiling demonstrations for the student.
Note that both teacher and student modules use the same
LM in our experiments,, which is the default approach in
DSPy,, but the teacher modules are executed on training ex-
amples and ﬁltered based on the metric.
Baselines include the Vanilla strategy that performs zero-
shot prediction with no LM Assertions applied and the
Compile strategy that compiles few-shot learning with the
naive DSPy optimizer. Our strategies explore when asser-
tions are applied: during inference (student only Infer
w/Assert ),, during compilation (teacher only Compilew /
Assert ),, or both ( C+Inferw/Assert ).
To ensure the baseline strategies are aware of the poten-
tial constraints,, we add complex instructions (prompts)
containing all the LM Assertion metrics in QuizGen and
TweetGen to all pipelines. In this way,, strategies with as-
sertions do not have the privilege of knowing the intrinsic
metrics. We also report experiments with minimal/generic
instructions in Appendix C,, where the baselines perform
much worse and give our assertion strategies more perfor-
mance advantages.
5.4. Results
Our evaluation aims to answer the following hypotheses:
H1LM Assertions facilitate automated self-correction
and reﬁnement through assertion-driven backtracking
for arbitrary LM pipelines by showing the LM past
outputs and error messages.
H2Assertion-driven backtracking with LM Assertions
can also enable LM pipelines to improve downstream
application performance.

Figure 2. Evaluation of each task on the validation set (Dev) and the te st set (Test). Tasks are described in Section 5.1,, and LM pipeline
conﬁguration are described in Table 1. For each task,, we use the same LM pipeline program except for the LM Assertions. Extrinsic
metrics (downstream application performance) are highlig hted in grey. For each metric,, higher is always better. The highest v alue in
each column is in bold .
LM Assertions bootstrap more robust and effective
examples/counterexamples,, aiding the goal of com-
plying more with the computational constraints and
achieving higher downstream performance.
5.4.1. H1: S ELF-CORRECTION VIA LM A SSERTIONS
To study this hypothesis,, we mainly look at the intrinsic
metrics of the tasks,, i.e.,, metrics that check if the LM
pipeline conforms to the constraints of the LM assertions
introduced. In Figure 2,, we observe that LM Assertions
consistently provide gains for all tasks when comparing
theVanilla andInfer w/Assert strategies. That is,, in
a zero-shot setting,, introducing our self-reﬁnement-base d
LM assertions substantially improves the pipeline’s abili ty
to conform to specs,, e.g. in the MultiHopQA task (Fig-
ure1),, the number of Suggestions Passed increases by
32.9% for the test set.
The increase is more prominent in the QuizGen task,, where
the LM program is tasked to generate a multiple-choice
quiz question in JSON format. Without LM Assertions,, themodel pipeline struggles to generate quizzes in valid JSON
(Correct JSON). However,, after including constraints that
the response should be in JSON and include the correct an-
swer as one of the choices,, together with backtracking and
self-reﬁnement to ﬁx these constraints,, the ﬁnal answers
have correct formatting 98.8% of the time and have the
right answer 76.6% of the time.
5.4.2. H2: P ERFORMANCE VIA SELF-CORRECTION
Next,, we focus on whether deﬁning suggestions in the
program can help achieve better downstream performance
by comparing Infer w/Assert withVanilla . We ob-
serve that on most tasks–MultiHopQA,, LongFormQA,, and
QuizGen–we get a moderate to large improvement on ex-
trinsic/downstream metrics ( grey columns) when sugges-
tions are deﬁned. Notably,, in QuizGen,, the overall Validity
of the quiz generated increases from 30.5% to 70.5%.
However,, on tasks like TweetGen,, we do not see a signiﬁ-
cant increase in the overall Quality of the generated tweet
on the test set. We believe this is a case of “conﬂicting

suggestions”,, where sequentially deﬁned suggestions can
override each other’s impact if they are hard to disentangle
during self-reﬁnement. We observe similar behavior in a
few experiments in the compiled strategies of Compilew /
Assert andC+Inferw/Assert and display a few exam-
ples in Appendix D.
5.4.3. H3: C OMPILING WITH LM A SSERTIONS
Then,, we explore an exciting use case of LM Assertions
to serve as the ﬁlter and optimizer for few-shot demonstra-
tions in prompt optimization. We evaluate all four tasks
on three settings: the baseline Compile ,, where the pro-
gram utilizes a DSPy optimizer to bootstrap few-shot exam-
ples;Compile w /Assert ,, where we enable suggestions
in the bootstrapping process only; and ﬁnally,, C+Infer
w/Assert ,, where suggestions and self-reﬁnements are en-
abled in both bootstrapping and compiled program during
inference.
By comparing Compile withCompilew /Assert ,, we ﬁnd
that constructing few-shot examples that adhere to LM As-
sertions and show the self-reﬁnement traces in the demon-
strations makes the LM pipeline more likely to adhere to
the same guidelines,, even without self-correction and back -
tracking. For example,, in the TweetGen experiment,, the
strategy compiled with suggestions has a 73.0% chance of
generating Engaging tweets,, while the baseline few-shot
strategy only generates 2.0%. Overall,, compiling with sug-
gestions helps tweet generation gain 30.7% more overall
Quality . For other tasks,, too,, compiling with assertions al-
most always shows stronger performance in intrinsic and
extrinsic metrics.
A surprising ﬁnding for TweetGen is the decrease in en-
gagement ( Engaging ) when compiling with assertions. We
inspect the responses of Compilew /Assert and ﬁnd that
the tweets are short,, thus less engaging. We suspect the
following reasons: ﬁrst,, the user-provided instruction to ﬁx
this suggestion may not be precise enough for an LLM to
follow. Second,, as we mentioned in the analysis for H2,,
some LM Assertions might conﬂict with each other,, mak-
ing discrete optimization of prompts challenging to satisf y
all constraints.
Finally,, we put everything together and build C+Infer w/
Assert where suggestions are enabled at all times . This
setting performs best for most intrinsic metrics over all
other strategies due to the high-quality few-shot examples
collected and runtime self-reﬁnement. In the MultiHopQA
question answering task,, the compiled module with sugges-
tions increases by 9.1% compared to the zero-shot baseline.
In QuizGen,, the zero-shot baseline only generates 30.5%
valid quiz questions,, while the ﬁnal compiled program is
valid 87.2% of the time. Similarly,, in TweetGen,, we see a
47.5% increase. In LongFormQA cited long passage ques-tion answering,, although all the suggestions are more likel y
to pass,, the answer inclusion ( Has Answer ) metric slightly
dropped; this suggests the opportunities to ﬁnd better LM
Assertions for this program that can potentially inﬂuence
the downstream tasks.
6. Related Work
Programming with constraints is standard in most program-
ming languages. Languages like Java ( Bartetzko et al. ,,
2001 ) and Python ( Python Software Foundation ,,2023 )
support assertions as ﬁrst-class statements to perform run -
time checks of certain properties. However,, most runtime
checks can only be used to warn the programmer or abort
the execution.
Kang et al. (2020 ) proposed a concept called model asser-
tions,, which can be used to monitor the behavior of ML
models and to improve the quality of a model in training
through data collection and weak supervision. LM Asser-
tions and the pipeline optimizations we perform with them
differ from model assertions in multiple ways: ﬁrst,, LM
Assertions can be used for backtracking an LM pipeline to
retry a failing module for self-reﬁnement,, which drastical ly
improves the performance of the pipeline; second,, LM As-
sertions can be used as ﬁlters to select better examples for
few-shot learning; ﬁnally,, LM Assertions aid generating
counterexamples and ﬁxing traces,, which further enhance
the LM pipeline to learn from past failures and improve.
More recent efforts on generating controllable outputs
for language models include LMQL ( Beurer-Kellner et al. ,,
2023 ),, NeMo Guardrails ( Rebedea et al. ,,2023 ),, etc. Al-
though these systems permit some sort of computation con-
straints,, they work on a single LM without consideration in
the LM pipeline setting,, which misses the assertion-driven
optimization opportunities proposed by our work.
By integrating Python-style assertions,, we ensure pro-
grammers can clearly express computational constraints
on DSPy programs and assert desired program behav-
ior. These declarative constraints are leveraged in exten-
sible and powerful ways to abstract and generalize no-
tions of self-reﬁnement and DSPy’s capabilities for prompt
optimization through compilation. We report on ini-
tial evaluation of an implementation that does so in this
work. Such self-reﬁnement of LLMs ( Madaan et al. ,,2023 ;
Shridhar et al. ,,2023 ) is central to this approach in making
DSPy autonomous and context-aware ( Tyen et al. ,,2023 ).
Enforcing methodologies of iterative reﬁnement using erro r
feedback ( Xu et al. ,,2023 ) and utilizing reasoning capabil-
ities through presenting past generations and feedback for
correction ( Qiu et al. ,,2023 ) resonates with the objective of
DSPy assertions.

7. Conclusion
We have introduced LM Assertions,, a new construct
for expressing arbitrary computational constraints on the
behavior of LMs when used as building blocks of
larger programs. We integrate LM Assertions into the
DSPy ( Khattab et al. ,,2024 ) programming model,, deﬁne
runtime retry semantics,, and an implementation for them
that abstracts and generalizes LM self-reﬁnement ap-
proaches to arbitrary steps in arbitrary pipelines. We also
discuss several other mechanisms that our LM Assertion
constructs can use to inform DSPy compilation into higher-
quality prompts that reduce the assertion failure rates. Ou r
evaluations show substantial gains on four case studies,, re -
porting both intrinsic (i.e.,, assertion-speciﬁc) and extr insic
(i.e.,, downstream) task metrics. By enabling DSPy pro-
grams to autonomously backtrack and self-correct and com-
pile better few-shot examples,, we hope to open avenues for
building more reliable LM programs at higher levels of ab-
straction than was previously possible.
Impact Statement
This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the ﬁeld
of Machine Learning. There are many potential societal
consequences of our work,, none which we feel must be

A. Implementation
We introduce the proposed LM Assertions as plug-in interfac es in the DSPy framework according to the semantics in
Section 3. Next,, we describe details about the design of our APIs and ho w we implement the semantics of both Assert and
Suggest in DSPy.
A.1. API Design
dspy.Assert(constraint: bool,, msg: Optional[ str],,
backtrack: Optional[module])
dspy.Suggest(constraint: bool,, msg: Optional[ str],,
backtrack: Optional[module])
We inherit a simple API design for LM Assertions. Both sugges tions and assertions take a boolean value constraint as
input. Note that the computation for constraint can invoke other DSPy modules,, potentially calling the LM to inform the
result for the constraint. Then,, the user provides an option al error message,, which is used for error logging and feedbac k
construction for backtracking and reﬁnement. Finally,, to e nable backtracking,, both dspy.Assert anddspy.Suggest contains
an optional backtrack argument,, which points to the target module to backtrack to i f the constraints fail.
A.2. Error Handlers
To implement various strategies of both assertions and sugg estions for different use cases,, we exploit Python’s native error
and exception handling.
We encode error-handling logic as function wrappers. To tha t extent,, we provide a primitive constraint _tranform to
wrap any DSPy module with handlers. When the constraints in dspy.Assert anddspy.Suggest are false,, they raise
AssertionError andSuggestionError ,, respectively. Then,, the dedicated error handling clause i n the function wrapper can
reroute the errors to the correct semantics.
As a result,, the program’s behavior after an assertion or sug gestion error is completely controlled by the handlers used .
To support ﬂexibility in using LM Assertions with DSPy,, we im plement several composable handlers,, such as disabling
suggestions and assertions,, suppressing assertion errors with logging,, etc.
The default handlers follow the semantics as described in Se ction 3to enable self-reﬁnement. That is,, we allow R
retry attempts for AssertionError andSuggestionError by backtracking to the failing LM. After Rretry attempts,, an
AssertionError will be raised while SuggestionError will only be logged silently.
A.3. Backtracking
To implement backtracking in DSPy,, we introduce a new auxili arymeta- module called Retry . This module is a lightweight
wrapper for any DSPy module,, providing additional informat ion about all previously unsuccessful predictions. When DS Py
determines the need to backtrack to a speciﬁc module,, it call sRetry . As shown in Figure 1,, theRetry module automatically
adds the failed predictions and the corresponding user-deﬁ ned error messages raised to the prompt. Then,, the LM pipelin e
can backtrack to the previously failed module with this upda ted prompt. In this way,, the original module to reﬁne is self-
aware and informed of past attempts and errors on them. Conse quently,, this empowers the LM to develop more informed
and error-avoiding generations in subsequent iterations o f self-reﬁnement.
B. Case Studies
B.1. LongFormQA
B.1.1. T ASK
In this task,, we build on the Multi-Hop QA (Figure 1) task by expecting long-form answers to questions that incl ude
citations to referenced context.
Figure 3shows an implementation of this task in DSPy. As shown,, it is n early identical to Figure 1outside of the introduc-
tion of a new dspy.ChainOfThought module that generates cited paragraphs referencing the ret rieved context. With this task

faithful to the retrieved context.
B.1.2. M ETRICS
We assess intrinsic performance using a sophisticated metr ic,, Citation Faithfulness. In this metric,, a small DSPy prog ram
uses the LM to check if the text preceding each citation appro priately supports the cited context. Our check outputs a
boolean for faithfulness,, which is then averaged across the citations in the output to aggregate a metric for evaluation . As
extrinsic metrics,, we use: (1) Answer Correctness,, verifyi ng if thegold answer is correctly incorporated; (2) Citation
Precision,, gauging the proportion of correctly cited title s; and (3) Citation Recall,, measuring the coverage of gold titles
cited.
B.1.3. C ONSTRAINTS SPECIFIED
As a simple initial check,, we include a Suggest statement that requires every 1–2 of sentences generated ha s citations in
an intended format. This is checked by a simple Python functi oncitations _check . As a more sophisticated check,, we
Suggest that the text preceding any citation must be faithful to the c ited context,, ensuring that the reference text accurately
represents the content of the cited information. Since this is a fuzzy condition,, we employ a small DSPy program (one
that uses the LM) to perform this check. Notably,, the robust A PI design of Suggest allows the user to specify arbitrary
expressions as conditional checks,, such as an LM call. The go al of this Suggest statement is to ensure that all sentences
are appropriately attributed to correct supporting source s.
B.2. QuizGen
B.2.1. T ASK
We introduce a new task stemming from the HotPotQA dataset in turning questions from the dataset into quiz questions by
generating possible answer choices for the question in a JSO N format.
This task is represented by a very simple program in DSPy with adspy.ChainOfThought module that generates a set of
answer choices based on a deﬁned question-answer pair and a s peciﬁed number of choices. To ensure well-deﬁned quiz
questions,, we aim for this task to adhere to consistent forma tting and offer a set of plausible distractor answer choices

alongside the actual correct answer to the question.
B.2.2. M ETRICS
We assess the task’s intrinsic performance across the follo wing metrics: (1) Valid Formatting; (2) Correct Answer Incl usion;
and (3) Choices’ Plausibility.
We verify consistent formatting by parsing the generated an swer choices and checking their consistency to maintain JSO N
formatting of key-value pairs.
We similarly ensure that the outputted answer choices inclu de the correct answer corresponding to the respective quest ion
from the HotPotQA dataset.
For determining the plausibility of the distractor choices ,, we build a DSPy program that relies on the LM to assess the
quality of the answer choice questions. This relies on the in puts: question,, generated answer choices,, and the assessme nt

plausibility veriﬁcation then outputs an assessment answe r of whether the distractors are plausible or not.
For the extrinsic metric,, we deﬁne a composite scoring metri c that considers the intrinsic metrics above. The metric
imposes that the conditions of valid formatting and correct answer inclusion are met,, thereby ensuring valid quiz quest ions.

tweeting style.
As we do with QuizChoiceGeneration,, we ensure the outputted tweet includes the correct answer corresponding to the
respective question from the HotPotQA dataset.
We also ensure that the generated tweet adheres to a characte r count limit of 280 characters to model sample tweet behavio r.
For determining the engagement of the tweet,, we build a DSPy p rogram that relies on the LM to assess this. This relies on
the inputs: question,, context,, generated tweet,, and the ass essment question we provide: Does the assessed text make for a
self-contained,, engaging tweet? This veriﬁcation outputs its assessment of whether the tweet is engaging in relation t o its
corresponding question and retrieved context.
We perform a similar assessment for the tweet’s faithfulnes s,, with the simple modiﬁcation to the assessment question: I s
the assessed text grounded in the context?
For the extrinsic metric,, we deﬁne a composite scoring metri c that considers all of the intrinsic metrics above. The metr ic
imposes that the most relevant intrinsic conditions of a wel l-formed tweet are met,, particularly if the tweet contains t he
correct answer to the question and is within the tweeting cha racter limit. When this case is met for the generated answer
choices,, we return an average score over all ﬁve of the intrin sic metrics. If either of these conditions is not met,, the sco re
defaults to 0.
B.3.3. C ONSTRAINTS SPECIFIED
To verify that the tweet contains no hashtags,, we include a Suggest statement that requires the tweet to be generated without
any hashtag phrases. This is checked by a simple Python funct ion through regex checks in has_no_hashtags .
To verify the generated tweet adheres to the character limit s,, we impose this through the Suggest statement to ensure that
the tweet is under the speciﬁed character limit,, which we spe cify as 280 in our experiments. This is checked by a simple
Python function is_within_length_limit .
Similarly,, we verify Correct Answer Inclusion with the Suggest statement that indicates if the answer choices do not
include the correct answer. This is checked by a simple Pytho n function has_correct_answer .
To verify the engagement level of the generated tweet,, we emp loy theSuggest statement to simply indicate whether the
tweet is engaging enough as determined by the LM and DSPy prog ram in place to assess engagement.
We conduct a similar approach for faithfulness as well,, chec king for the tweet’s faithfulness to its retrieved context.
C. Impact on Using Different LLM Instructions
We explore comparative tests in the speciﬁed instructions f or the case studies mentioned above. We differentiate betwe en a
primitive instruction that aims to simply specify a task’s o bjective and a complete instruction that accounts for the re spective
intrinsic and extrinsic metric measured for the task. These tests are conducted speciﬁcally on the TweetGen and QuizGen
tasks which encompass more complex metrics. Our experiment s on the complete instructions are presented in Figure 2
while we demonstrate our results on the primitive instructi ons below.
C.1. TweetGen
Primitive instruction: ""Generate a tweet that effectively answers a question.""
Complete instruction with metrics accounted for: ""Generat e an engaging tweet that effectively answers a question stay ing

C.3. Discussion
Based on these experiments on primitive instructions,, we di scovered that when the baseline pipeline only has access to h igh-
level and generic instructions,, it is almost impossible for the pipeline to follow the underlying constraints. For exam ple,,
in QuizGen,, the baseline Vanilla strategy only generates 2.8% of quizzes with Correct JSON format and 2.6% of quizzes
that contains the correct answer.
However,, for our assertion-driven optimization enabled pi pelines,, the performance on primitive experiments are stil l com-
parable to the counter-part with complex instructions. Thi s indicates that model pipelines with LM Assertions and asse rtion-
driven optimizations are less sensitive to instructions,, r equiring less effort on manual prompt tuning.

Abstract
Multi-label classification problems with thou-
sands of classes are hard to solve with in-
context learning alone,, as language models
(LMs) might lack prior knowledge about the
precise classes or how to assign them,, and
it is generally infeasible to demonstrate ev-
ery class in a prompt. We propose a general
program,, Infer–Retrieve–Rank ,, that defines
multi-step interactions between LMs and re-
trievers to efficiently tackle such problems. We
implement this program using the DSPy pro-
gramming model,, which specifies in-context
systems in a declarative manner,, and use DSPy
optimizers to tune it towards specific datasets
by bootstrapping only tens of few-shot exam-
ples. Our primary extreme classification pro-
gram,, optimized separately for each task,, at-
tains state-of-the-art results across three bench-
marks (HOUSE,, TECH,, TECHWOLF). We
apply the same program to a benchmark with
vastly different characteristics and attain com-
petitive performance as well (BioDEX). Unlike
prior work,, our proposed solution requires no
finetuning,, is easily applicable to new tasks,, al-
leviates prompt engineering,, and requires only
tens of labeled examples. Our code is public at
https://github.com/KarelDO/xmc.dspy .
1 Introduction
Extreme multi-label classification (XMC) tasks are
hard to solve with in-context learning alone. Lan-
guage models (LMs) might lack prior knowledge
about the precise classes,, and the sheer number
of available classes—often upwards of 10,,000—
generally means it is infeasible even to demon-
strate every class in a prompt. To deal with this,,
some recent efforts make multiple LM calls at in-
ference time (Zhu and Zamani,, 2023),, while others
prompt LMs to generate synthetic data for finetun-
ing (Decorte et al.,, 2023; Clavié and Soulié,, 2023).
These methods can be configured to work well,,
but they all have manual “knobs” like prompts andother hyperparameters that make applying them to
new datasets,, metrics,, or LMs challenging.
In this paper,, we show that simple programs
written using the DSPy programming model (Khat-
tab et al.,, 2023) support powerful,, highly gen-
eral approaches to XMC tasks. DSPy allows
us to separately specify the modular program
of our method and how it should be optimized
towards different datasets. We propose a sim-
ple in-context program for XMC tasks called
Infer–Retrieve–Rank (IReRa ,, Figure 1,, Step 1).
First,, an LM processes the input document and
guesses a set of applicable terms ( Infer ). Then,, a
retriever relates each predicted term to the actual
label space ( Retrieve ). Finally,, an LM is used to
rerank retrieved labels ( Rank ). Crucially,, we use a
frozen retriever and frozen LMs. The key insights
ofInfer–Retrieve–Rank is that such a frozen re-
triever can be made much more flexible if the LM
learns in-context how to predict relevant queries
and interpret the retrieved results.
The underlying LMs,, retriever,, and prompts are
considered hyperparameters of theIReRa program,,
which can be tuned automatically or easily con-
figured. Using only 10 unlabeled training inputs,,
and≈50 labeled validation examples,, we bootstrap
a few-shot prompt for our two LM components,,
using a zero-shot teacher LM with a minimal seed-
prompt (Figure 1,, Step 2). DSPy ’s compilation ab-
straction handles this nicely; it takes the program
logic we’ve already defined,, instantiates it with a
teacher LM,, processes the unlabeled training ex-
amples,, generates zero-shot labels for each of the
program steps,, and picks the best labels to put in a
few-shot prompt based on validation performance.
Because our program consists of two in-context
modules,, we propose to bootstrap them sequen-
tially (Figure 1,, Step 3).
In our experiments,, we instantiate the Infer
module with a Llama-2-7b-chat model (Touvron
et al.,, 2023),, while the teacher model used for boot-arXiv:2401.12178v1  [cs.CL]  22 Jan 2024",124023861f14b16485e895660949b826

with an extreme amount of classes ( ≥10,,000). Given an input,, a first in-context learning module predicts queries
which route to a frozen retriever. The retrieved documents are re-ranked by a second in-context module ( Step 1 ).
Given a minimal prompt ( Step 2 ),, a zero-shot Teacher LM bootstraps demonstrations to optimize the few-shot
Student LM (Step 3 ). Optimization using ≈50 labeled inputs can yield state-of-the-art results,, using only ≈20
Teacher and ≈1,,500 Student calls. The (optimization) logic is expressed using the DSPy programming model.
strapping is GPT-3.5 . TheRank module is instanti-
ated and bootstrapped both by a GPT-4 model.
Adapting Infer–Retrieve–Rank to a new
dataset can be as simple as (i) writing a new mini-
mal zero-shot prompt,, (ii) configuring which LMs
to use,, and (iii) running the optimization proce-
dure. We optimize this program separately towards
4 XMC datasets: one dataset involving the extract-
ing and coding of adverse drug events expressed in
biomedical literature (BioDEX; D’Oosterlinck et al.
2023) and three datasets involving the labeling of
job vacancy snippets with the required competen-
cies they express (HOUSE,, TECH,, TECHWOLF;
Zhang et al. 2022; Decorte et al. 2022,, 2023). Our
program attains state-of-the-art results on the job
vacancy datasets,, and gets meaningful traction on
the harder biomedical task—without finetuning,,
without prompt engineering,, and by using only ≈50
labeled examples. We find that the optimization is
a consistent driver of performance across tasks.
2 Related Work
The canonical way of tackling an extreme classi-
fication problem involves either finetuning a spe-
cialized retriever over the label space or finetuningone binary classifier per class (Decorte et al.,, 2022,,
2023; Clavié and Soulié,, 2023). These methods
require a lot of data,, since every one of the many
classes requires at least a few labeled examples.
To avoid manual data labeling,, researchers use dis-
tant supervision (Decorte et al.,, 2022),, bootstrap
synthetic data using LLMs (Decorte et al.,, 2023;
Clavié and Soulié,, 2023; De Raedt et al.,, 2023),, or
finetune retrievers on adjacent problems where data
is available (Remy et al.,, 2022). At inference time,,
an additional LLM call can be used to rerank a list
of generated candidate labels to further increase
performance (Clavié and Soulié,, 2023).
Zhu and Zamani (2023) use multiple GPT-3.5
calls combined with retrieval at inference-time to
bootstrap a synthetic prompt per input,, infer labels,,
and rerank them. While they do not use any fine-
tuning,, they require many LLM and retrieval calls
per input. They evaluate on two recommendation
tasks,, where inputs and outputs are the same type
of documents. Bhatia et al. (2016) formulate many
recommendation tasks under the XMC setting. In-
stead,, we consider XMC tasks where inputs and
outputs are not of similar shape,, and more inference
or information extraction is needed.",559fbf7c2489590e81faf683e7a53cdc

put,, making it efficient to develop and deploy.
Infer–Retrieve–Rank can achieve state-of-the-

Unlike prior work,, our program logic is defined
in a modular and declarative manner,, and can be
seamlessly applied to different benchmarks given a
minimal seed-prompt. Optimization happens auto-
matically and can resolve in as little as ten minutes.
The choice of LMs and retrievers can be configured,,
ensuring relevance when stronger components be-
come available. Finally,, we write at most one seed-
prompt per task and in-context module,, and let
optimization—not iterative prompt engineering—
take care of increasing performance.
3Infer–Retrieve–Rank
The program for Infer–Retrieve–Rank is given
in Code Snippet 1,, with minor alterations for
brevity. First,, an LM is used to predict queries
given the input ( Infer ). The retriever outputs a
ranking over all labels based on maximum cosine
embedding similarity with the queries ( Retrieve ).
The top labels are reranked by another LM ( Rank ).

Not all labels occur with equal frequency. Fine-
tuned methods can implicitly learn this bias given
enough data. If available,, we propose to use the

the retrieval similarity sito account for this. The

To apply Infer–Retrieve–Rank to a dataset,, a
minimal seed-prompt needs to define the behav-
ior of each in-context module. Code Snippet 2
contains the prompt for the Infer module on the
BioDEX dataset,, neatly organized using the DSPy
Signature abstraction. This seed-prompt defines
a task description in the docstring,, and input and
output fields with descriptions and formatting in-
formation. The Signature serves as skeleton for
both zero- and few-shot prompts.

consists of biomedical papers containing various
descriptions of adverse drug events and associated
expert-created labels for the exact type of medi-
cal reaction discussed. These events are encoded
in the MedDRA ontology (Medical Dictionary for
Regulatory Activities; Brown et al. 1999),, a set
of≈24,,300 standardized medical reaction. Inputs
can be very long (half of inputs have upwards
of≈20,,000 characters),, and biomedical domain
knowledge is needed to infer the correct reactions
(not all medical reactions need to be reported,, only
theadverse ones). BioDEX models a crucial step
in real-world drug safety pipelines. We use a subset
of 10 training,, 50 validation,, and 250 test examples
for our experiments. The median amount of labels
per input is 3 while the 95th percentile is 14.
1WhenK=Rn,, the precision and the recall of the ranking
are by definition equal (Aslam et al.,, 2005).ESCO: The ESCO ontology (European Commis-
sion Directorate-General for Employment,, Social
Affairs and Inclusion,, 2017) contains ≈13,,900 dis-
tinct concepts used to encode skills,, competences,,
qualifications,, and occupations. We consider three
datasets each containing snippets (typically one
sentence) of online job vacancies in English with
their relevant ESCO labels. We use the HOUSE,,
TECH,, and TECHWOLF datasets (Zhang et al.,,
2022; Decorte et al.,, 2022,, 2023). We take 10
examples each from the HOUSE and TECH valida-
tion sets as training examples,, and keep the remain-
ing 51 and 65 examples as validation respectively.
TECHWOLF has no validation or training split,, so
we use the train and validation split of HOUSE
instead. HOUSE,, TECH,, and TECHWOLF respec-
tively contain 262,, 338,, and 326 test examples.
The median amount of labels per input across these
datasets is 1 and the 95th percentile is 4.
7 Experiments and Results
Table 1 gives test results for all models and tasks.
Baselines We evaluate a set of baselines across
the four tasks. First,, we evaluate a ranking
equal to the prior statistic over all the labels
(prior ). For BioDEX,, we estimate these pri-
ors across all the BioDEX training data. For
the ESCO datasets,, we use the priors distributed
by Decorte et al. (2023),, which are calculated
from a private training set. Subsequently we evalu-
ate the performance of exactly matching the label
names in the input document ( exact-match ). Fi-
nally,, we embed the input document with an off-
the-shelf retriever and retrieve over label embed-
dings. We use the pre-trained all-mpnet-base-v2
model (Reimers and Gurevych,, 2019) for ESCO-
tasks and BioLORD (Remy et al.,, 2022),, a biomedi-
cal retriever,, for BioDEX ( naive-retrieve ).
Through these baselines,, an interesting dis-
tinction between BioDEX and the ESCO-tasks
emerges. Off-the-shelf retrieval is much stronger
on ESCO-tasks. We hypothesize this is due to
the shape of the input documents. Entire biomedi-
cal publications are hard to compress into a single
vector—especially with an off-the-shelf retriever.
The short vacancy snippets are easier to handle.
Infer–Retrieve–Rank We instantiate the
Infer module with a Llama-2-7b-chat stu-
dent LM and GPT-3.5-turbo teacher LM. The
Rank module uses GPT-4 as both student and",de33e5eedbb656eded2850ebd14a952a

We optimize Infer–Retrieve–Rank for
RP@10 performance on each dataset sepa-
rately. Each run involves 10 unlabeled training
examples and ≈50 labeled validation exam-
ples. Every run incurs ≈20 teacher model
calls and≈1,,500 student model calls,, and can
complete in tens of minutes. We use dspy ’s
BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch class to
automate the prompt bootstrapping procedure. A
detailed breakdown of optimization and inference
costs,, in function of the different LMs used,, is
given in Section 8. We set the prior hyperparameter
Ato 0 for ESCO-tasks and 1000 for BioDEX,,
based on a handful of validation runs.
For ESCO-tasks,, we compare with the best
finetuned systems from the literature. retrieve
denotes the retriever of Decorte et al. (2023),,
retrieve-rankGPT3.5/4 denotes the system with
inference-time reranking of Clavié and Soulié
(2023). For BioDEX,, we slightly alter the
method of D’Oosterlinck et al. (2023): we take
aFLAN-T5-Large model (Chung et al.,, 2022) and
train it to output a comma-separated list of reactionlabels given a chunk of the input paper (the origi-
nal BioDEX system was trained to output many at-
tributes,, of which medical reactions was only one).
This model does not directly produce a ranking,, so
if a reaction is not predicted we add it in order of
the prior ( seq2seq-prior ). We also consider sam-
pling 10 generations from the model and majority
voting the reactions ( 10×seq2seq-prior ).
Infer–Retrieve–Rank achieves state-of-the-
art performance across all ESCO-tasks. Through
a set of ablations,, we find that each optimization
step and module improves performance. Notable,,
theInfer-Retrieve system,, which ablates the
Rank module,, can still attain competitive results
despite using only one open-source LM and frozen
retriever. Infer–Retrieve–Rank does not beat our
finetuned system on BioDEX,, but adding a Rank
module or optimizing Infer consistently improves
performance,, indicating that programs can support
a general approaches to extreme multi-label classi-
fication across a variety of datasets with different
characteristics.",52bc52896991b932934cb0fe8528e098

Table 2: Breakdown of configuration and costs associated with our Modules andPrograms . A module is configured
with a single LM and Teacher. A program inherits all LMs of its modules,, and all Teachers of its optimized modules.
Per module,, the optimization procedure requires O(train )Teacher calls and num_programs ⋅O(val)LM calls,,
where num_programs is a hyperparameter controlling how many programs to try during optimization. During
inference,, 1 LM call is used per module. Programs inherit the optimization calls of their optimized modules,, and the
inference calls of all modules. While Retrieve is not directly optimized,, it does contribute inference calls to the
optimization of Infer-Retrieve because the Retrieve module is in the optimization loop. In this work,, we use
10 training examples,, ≈50 validation examples,, and set num_programs to 10.
8 Program Cost Breakdown
Table 2 outlines the optimization and inference
calls associated with our modules and programs.
A module is always instantiated with one LM,,
but can also have another Teacher LM if it is
optimizable. In our case,, the Infer andRank
modules have a Teacher while Retrieve does
not. Optimizing a module given its inputs in-
cursO(train )calls from the Teacher model and
num_programs ⋅O(validation )calls from the Stu-
dent LM,, where train andvalidation denote the
sizes of the training and validation sets respectively,,
andnum_programs controls how many different
bootstrapped prompts to try in the optimization
process. In our work,, this results in ≈10 Teacher
and≈500 LM calls per module.
Programs inherit the configuration and calls from
their constituent modules. Teacher optimization
calls are only inherited if the module is actually
optimized,, LM optimization calls are inherited if
the module is in the loop for another optimized
module,, and inference calls are always inherited.
Table 2 makes it easy to express the cost as-
sociated with any program. For example,, our
state-of-the-art Infer–Retrieve–Rank program
requires approximately 500 Llama ,, 500mpnet ,, 10
GPT3.5 ,, and 510 GPT4 calls to optimize. This is
calculated as follows. First,, 500 Llama and 500mpnet student LM calls and 10 GPT3.5 teacher
calls are needed to optimize Infer-Retrieve .
Then an additional 500 GPT4 student LM calls
and 10GPT4 teacher calls are needed to optimize
Rank . Notice how Infer-Retrieve is in the loop
whileInfer–Retrieve–Rank is optimized. Be-
cause of the left-to-right nature of this optimiza-
tion procedure,, we can cache the inference calls of
Infer-Retrieve ,, saving us the cost of executing
them again when optimizing Rank . Per new input,,
the program incurs 1 call for each Llama ,,mpnet ,,
andGPT4 LM.
The finetuned systems we compare to in Table 1
all have a much higher start-up cost,, in part due to
the need for labeled finetuning data—which some
systems need to bootstrap—and other costs asso-
ciated with finetuning such as increased hardware
requirements. These finetuned systems can be more
efficient per test-time input,, given that we currently
rely on 2 open-source local calls and 1 closed-
source API call for Infer–Retrieve–Rank . Our
Infer-Retrieve program is considerably cheaper
to deploy since it relies only on open-source com-
ponents,, while still being competitive. In the fu-
ture,, we plan to use an open-source LM for Rank ,,
making our best program considerably cheaper to
deploy as well.",1a29df27f44ca1ce08ef93a9c03a7479
2024-04-08 02:25:51.419,740562,file:/Workspace/Users/odl_instructor_771155@databrickslabs.com/raw_pdfs/2401.12178.pdf,"9 Conclusion
We introduced Infer–Retrieve–Rank ,, a general
program for extreme multi-label classification.
Infer–Retrieve–Rank achieves state-of-the-art
results on three benchmarks using one frozen re-
triever combine with two in-context learning mod-
ules. These findings show that the future of prompt
and pipeline engineering need not be brittle. Mod-
ular programs,, once optimized,, can serve as highly
effective general-purpose solutions.
Limitations
The best Infer–Retrieve–Rank program cur-
rently requires one GPT-4 call per input document,,
which may not feasible for all applications. In the
future,, we plan to explore more efficient versions
ofInfer–Retrieve–Rank which rely fully on low-
cost open-source components.
While our optimization procedure allevi-
ates the need for iterative prompt engineering,,
Infer–Retrieve–Rank does rely on an initial
seed-prompt and performance may vary with spu-
rious features of these prompts. In the future,,
we plan to quantify how different optimization
procedures can reduce prompt brittleness,, using
Infer–Retrieve–Rank and our benchmark suite.
Ethics Statement
We have applied Infer–Retrieve–Rank to the im-
portant real-world tasks of biomedical informa-
tion extraction and job vacancy screening. LMs
make mistakes and are biased towards certain pre-
dictions (Bender et al.,, 2021). We advise against
the deployment of Infer–Retrieve–Rank in these
crucial real-world tasks without proper understand-
ing of the risks involved and how to best measure
and mitigate them.

Composing retrieval and language models for knowledge-intensive NLP
Omar Khattab1Keshav Santhanam1Xiang Lisa Li1David Hall1
Percy Liang1Christopher Potts1Matei Zaharia1
Abstract
Retrieval-augmented in-context learning has
emerged as a powerful approach for addressing
knowledge-intensive tasks using frozen language
models (LM) and retrieval models (RM). Exist-
ing work has combined these in simple “retrieve-
then-read” pipelines in which the RM retrieves
passages that are inserted into the LM prompt.
To begin to fully realize the potential of frozen
LMs and RMs,, we propose DEMONSTRATE –
SEARCH –PREDICT (DSP ),, a framework that re-
lies on passing natural language texts in sophisti-
cated pipelines between an LM and an RM. DSP
can express high-level programs that bootstrap
pipeline-aware demonstrations,, search for rele-
vant passages,, and generate grounded predictions,,
systematically breaking down problems into small
transformations that the LM and RM can handle
more reliably. We have written novel DSP pro-
grams for answering questions in open-domain,,
multi-hop,, and conversational settings,, establish-
ing in early evaluations new state-of-the-art in-
context learning results and delivering 37–120%,,
8–39%,, and 80–290% relative gains against the
vanilla LM (GPT-3.5),, a standard retrieve-then-
read pipeline,, and a contemporaneous self-ask
pipeline,, respectively. We release DSP athttps:

1. Introduction
In-context learning adapts a frozen language model (LM) to
tasks by conditioning the LM on a textual prompt including
task instructions and a few demonstrating examples (Mc-
Cann et al.,, 2018; Radford et al.,, 2019; Brown et al.,, 2020).
For knowledge-intensive tasks such as question answering,,
fact checking,, and information-seeking dialogue,, retrieval
models (RM) are increasingly used to augment prompts

with relevant information from a large corpus (Lazaridou
et al.,, 2022; Press et al.,, 2022; Khot et al.,, 2022).
Recent work has shown such retrieval-augmented in-context
learning to be effective in simple “retrieve-then-read”
pipelines: a query is fed to the RM and the retrieved pas-
sages become part of a prompt that provides context for
the LM to use in its response. In this work,, we argue that
the fact that both LMs and RMs consume (and generate or
retrieve) natural language texts creates an opportunity for
much more sophisticated interactions between them. Fully
realizing this would be transformative: frozen LMs and
RMs could serve as infrastructure across tasks,, enabling
ML- and domain-experts alike to rapidly build grounded
AI systems at a high level of abstraction and with lower
deployment overheads and annotation costs.
Figure 1 begins to illustrate the power of retrieval-
augmented in-context learning,, but also the limitations of
“retrieve-then-read” (Lazaridou et al.,, 2022; Izacard et al.,,
2022). Our query is “How many storeys are in the castle
David Gregory inherited?” When prompted to answer this,,
GPT-3.5 ( text-davinci-002 ; Ouyang et al. 2022) makes
up a ﬁctitious castle with incorrect attributes,, highlighting
the common observation that knowledge stored in LM pa-
rameters is often unreliable (Shuster et al.,, 2021; Ishii et al.,,
2022). Introducing an RM component helps,, as the LM
can ground its responses in retrieved passages,, but a rigidarXiv:2212.14024v2  [cs.CL]  23 Jan 2023",bff082622fe092c98d6f331c6970bfd8

Figure 2. A toy example of a DSP program for multi-hop question answering. Given an input question and a 2-shot training set,, the
DEMONSTRATE stage programmatically annotates intermediate transformations on the training examples using a form of weak supervision.
Learning from a resulting demonstration ,, the SEARCH stage decomposes the complex input question and retrieves supporting information
over two retrieval hops. Finally,, the P REDICT stage uses the demonstration and retrieved passages to answer the question.
retrieve-then-read strategy fails because the RM cannot ﬁnd
passages that directly answer the question.

tirely on passing natural language text (and scores) be-
tween a frozen RM and LM.DSP introduces a num-
ber of composable functions that bootstrap training exam-

(PREDICT ),, using them to systematically unify techniques
from the retrieval-augmented NLP and the in-context learn-
ing literatures (Lee et al.,, 2019; Khattab et al.,, 2021a; Anan-
tha et al.,, 2020; Gao et al.,, 2022; Izacard et al.,, 2022; Dohan
et al.,, 2022; Zelikman et al.,, 2022; Zhang et al.,, 2022).
We use DSP to suggest powerful strategies for knowledge-
intensive tasks with compositions of these techniques. This
reveals new conceptual possibilities for in-context learning
in general (§2),, and it allows us to present rich programs
that set new state-of-the-art results (§3).
Figure 1 shows the path that a DSP program might take to
arrive at an answer,, and Figure 2 illustrates how a deliberate
program achieves this. Instead of asking the LMto answer
this complex question,, the program’s SEARCH stage uses the
LMto generate a query “Which castle did David Gregory
inherit?” The RM retrieves a passage saying Gregory inher-
ited the Kinnairdy Castle. After a second search “hop” ﬁnds
the castle’s number of storeys,, the PREDICT stage queries
theLM with these passages to answer the original question.
Although this program implements behaviors such as query
generation,, it requires no hand-labeled examples of these
intermediate transformations (i.e.,, of the queries and pas-
sages of both retrieval hops). Instead,, the DEMONSTRATEstage uses labeled question–answer pairs to implement a
form of weak supervision that programmatically annotates
the transformations invoked within SEARCH andPREDICT .
We evaluate several DSP programs on answering questions
in open-domain,, multi-hop,, and conversational settings. In
them,, we implement novel and reusable transformations
such as bootstrapping annotations for all of our pipelines
with weak supervision (§2.3),, reliably rewriting questions to
resolve conversational dependencies and iteratively decom-
pose complex queries with summarization of intermediate
hops (§2.4),, and generating grounded responses from mul-
tiple passages with self-consistency (§2.5). We report pre-
liminary results on Open-SQuAD,, HotPotQA,, and QReCC
using the frozen LMGPT-3.5 and RM ColBERTv2 (Khat-
tab & Zaharia,, 2020; Santhanam et al.,, 2022b) with no
ﬁne-tuning. Our DSP programs deliver 37–120%,, 8–39%,,
and 80–290% relative gains against corresponding vanilla
LMs,, a standard retrieve-then-read pipeline,, and a contem-
poraneous self-ask pipeline (Press et al.,, 2022),, respectively.
Future versions of this report will include additional test
tasks and LMchoices.
In summary,, this work makes the following contributions.
First,, we argue that simple task-agnostic pipelines for in-
context learning should give way to deliberate,, task-aware
strategies. Second,, we show that this shift need not be a
burden: with DSP ,, such strategies can be easily expressed
as short programs using composable operators. Third,, this
composability spawns powerful capacities,, like automati-
cally annotating demonstrations for complex pipelines from
end-task labels. Fourth,, for three knowledge-intensive tasks,,
we implement rich programs that establish state-of-the-art
results for in-context learning.",4af4933d765667b64e9ef18cd625c01b

2. D EMONSTRATE –SEARCH –PREDICT
We now introduce the DSP framework and show its expres-
sive power by suggesting a number of strategies in which
theLM andRM can come together to tackle complex prob-
lems effectively. We show in §3 that such strategies out-
perform existing in-context learning methods. We begin by
discussing the LMandRM foundation modules on which
DSP is built (§2.1) and then the datatypes and control ﬂow
within DSP (§2.2). Subsequently,, we discuss each of the
three inference stages: DEMONSTRATE (§2.3),, SEARCH
(§2.4),, and P REDICT (§2.5).
2.1. Pretrained Modules: LM and RM
ADSP program deﬁnes the communication between the
language model LMand the retrieval model RM.
Language Model We invoke a frozen language model
LM to conditionally generate (orscore ) text. For each
invocation,, the program prepares a prompt that adapts the
LM to a speciﬁc function (e.g.,, answering questions or
generating queries). A prompt often includes instructions,,
a few demonstrations of the desired behavior,, and an input
query to be answered.
As in Figure 2,, the LM generates not only: (i)the ﬁnal
answer to the input question (in the PREDICT stage),, but also
(ii)intermediate “hop” queries to ﬁnd useful information
for the input question ( SEARCH ) as well as (iii)exemplar
queries that illustrate how to produce queries for questions
in the training set ( DEMONSTRATE ). This systematic use of
theLMis a hallmark of DSP programs.
Retrieval Model DSP programs also invoke a frozen re-
trieval model RM toretrieve the top- kmost “relevant”
text sequences for a given query . The RM canindex a
massive set of pre-deﬁned passages for scalable search,, and
those passages can be updated without changing the retrieval
parameters. The RM accepts free-form textual inputs and
specializes in estimating the relevance (or similarity) of a
text sequence to a query.
As in Figure 2,, the RM is responsible for retrieving (i)
passages for each query generated by the LM(during the
SEARCH stage),, but also (ii)passages that are used within
demonstrations ( DEMONSTRATE ). In the latter case,, the
RM’s contributions are less about providing directly rel-
evant information to the input question and more about
helping the LMadapt to the domain and task.
Though not utilized in this example,, the RM is also used in
DSP for functions like retrieving “nearest-neighbor” demon-
strations from task training data ( DEMONSTRATE ) and se-
lecting well-grounded generated sequences from the LM
(PREDICT ).2.2. Datatypes and Control Flow
We have implemented the DSP framework in Python. The
present section introduces the core data types and compos-
able functions provided by the framework. We use illustra-
tive code snippets to ground the examples,, and to convey
the power that comes from being able to express complex
interactions between the LMandRM in simple programs.
The Example Datatype To conduct a task,, a DSP pro-
gram manipulates one or more instances of the Example
datatype. An Example behaves like a Python dictionary
with multiple ﬁelds. The program is typically provided with
a few training examples. The code snippet below illustrates
this for multi-hop question answering.
1from dsp import Example
2
3train = [ Example ( question ="" When was the discoverer
of Palomar 4 born ?"",, answer ="" 1889 ""),,
4 Example ( question =""In which city did Akeem
Ellis play in 2017? "",, answer ="" Ellesmere Port "")]
This snippet contains two labeled examples,, each with a
multi-hop question (e.g.,, “In which city did Akeem Ellis
play in 2017?”) and its short answer (“Ellesmere Port”).
Arbitrary keys and values are allowed within an Example ,,
though typical values are strings or lists of strings.
In this task,, we are unlikely to ﬁnd an individual passage
that provides the answer to any question. For example,, the
ﬁrst training example can probably be resolved only by ﬁrst
answering the question of who discovered Palomar (“Edwin
Hubble”) and then addressing the question of Hubble’s birth
date using different evidence passages. We typically assume
that the human-labeled training data do notinclude labels
for intermediate transformations (e.g.,, queries for individual
hops) that would be useful for following these steps,, and so
it is the job of the DSP program to discover these strategies
via in-context learning.
A DSP Program The following code snippet is a com-
plete program for resolving multi-hop questions like those
in Figure 1,, with help from train examples like those above.
1def multihop_program ( question : str ) -> str :
2 x = Example ( question = question ,, train = train )
3 x = multihop_demonstrate (x)
4 x = multihop_search (x)
5 x = multihop_predict (x)
6 return x. answer
7
8multihop_program ("" How many storeys does the castle
David Gregory inherited have ?"")
9# => "" five storeys ""
The program takes the input (here,, a question) and outputs
the system output (its short answer). It starts by creating
anExample for the input question and assigning the train
ﬁeld to the training set from the previous snippet. Programs",1f7c9c0085b394279eb99dccb547612b

invoke and compose DSP primitives (i.e.,, built-in functions)
to build the DEMONSTRATE ,,SEARCH ,, and PREDICT trans-
formations that deﬁne the program.
Transformations A transformation is a function that
takes an Example as input and returns an Example ,, pop-
ulating new ﬁelds (or modifying existing ﬁelds) in it. This
program invokes three developer-deﬁned transformations,,
namely,, multihop_demonstrate ,,multihop_search ,, and
multihop_predict . Transformations may themselves in-
voke other transformations,, and they act analogously to
layers in standard deep neural network (DNN) program-
ming frameworks such as PyTorch,, except that they pass
text data instead of tensors between each other and do not
involve backpropagation.
We categorize transformations according to their behavior
(or purpose) under one of the DEMONSTRATE ,,SEARCH ,,
andPREDICT stages. That said,, DSP does not impose this
categorization and allows us to deﬁne functions that may
blend these stages. We will discuss each of the three stages
next.
2.3. D EMONSTRATE
It is known that including examples of the desired behavior
from the LMin its prompt typically leads to better perfor-
mance (Brown et al.,, 2020). In DSP ,, ademonstration is a
training example that has been prepared to illustrate speciﬁc
desired behaviors from the LM. ADEMONSTRATE transfor-
mation takes as input xof type Example and prepares a list
of demonstrations in x.demos ,, typically by selecting a sub-
set of the training examples in x.train andbootstrapping
new ﬁelds in them.
Bootstrapping Demonstrations Examples in the train-
ing set typically consist of the input text and the target
output of the task. The DEMONSTRATE stage can aug-
ment a training example by programmatically bootstrapping
annotations for intermediate transformations. In our run-
ning “multi-hop” example,, the demonstrations illustrate
three LM-based transformations: (i)how to break down the
input question in order to gather information for answer-
ing it (i.e.,, ﬁrst-hop retrieval),, (ii)how to use information
gathered in an earlier “hop” to ask follow-up questions,, and
(iii)how to use the information gathered to answer complex
questions.
1Examples = list [ Example ]
2Transformation = Callable [[ Example ],,
3 Optional [ Example ]]
4
5annotate ( train : Examples ,, fn: Transformation )
6 -> Examples
Akin to a specialized map,, the annotate primitive accepts
a user-deﬁned transformation fnand applies it over a listof training examples. Whenever fnreturns an example
(rather than None ),,annotate caches the intermediate pre-
dictions (i.e.,, the generated queries and retrieved passages).
These predictions serve as successful demonstrations for the
pipeline transformations. In simple uses,, fnmay attempt
to answer the example “zero-shot” one or more times. This
is typically done by invoking the SEARCH andPREDICT
stages of the program. When an answer is produced,, if
fnassesses it as correct,, it returns a populated example in
which the intermediate predictions are present.
Case Study The snippet below deﬁnes the func-
tion multihop_demonstrate ,, called in Line 3 of
multihop_program ,, and illustrates the usage of annotate .
1from dsp import sample ,, annotate
2
3def attempt_example (d: Example ):
4 d = d. copy ( demos =[])
5 d = multihop_search (d)
6 d = multihop_predict (d)
7 return d if d. pred == d. answer else None
8
9def multihop_demonstrate (x: Example ):
10 demos = annotate (x.train ,, attempt_example )
11 return Example (x,, demos = demos )
In Line 10,, multihop_demonstrate invokes annotate ,,
which bootstraps missing ﬁelds in training examples by
caching annotations from attempt_example . The transfor-
mation attempt_example takes a training example dand
attempts to answer it in a zero-shot fashion: it creates a copy
ofdwith no demonstrations (Line 4; i.e.,, zero-shot) and
invokes the multi-hop search and predict pipeline (Lines 5
and 6). Each transformation returns an updated version of
dwith additional ﬁelds populated. If the pipeline answers
correctly (Line 7),, the updated dis returned.
Figure 2 illustrates this behavior. DEMONSTRATE trans-
forms a training question–answer pair to a fully-populated
demonstration,, including ﬁelds such as hop1 andhop2 (i.e.,,
queries for multi-hop search) as well as psg1 andpsg2 .
When the LMis later invoked to conduct a transformation,,
say,, generating a “second-hop” query during SEARCH ,, the
psg1 ﬁeld serves as context and the hop2 ﬁeld serves as a
label for this particular training example.
Discussion This simple case study illustrates the power of
composition in the DSP abstraction. Because the pipeline
is a well-deﬁned program in which transformations com-
municate by passing text attached to Example s,, a simple
map-and-ﬁlter strategy can leverage the LM andRM to
bootstrap annotations for a full pipeline from end-task la-
bels. This is an extensible strategy,, but even in its simplest
form it generalizes the approaches explored recently by Ze-
likman et al. (2022),, Wei et al. (2022),, Zhang et al. (2022),,
and Huang et al. (2022) in which an LM self-generates
chain-of-thought rationales for an individual prompt.",7be41b25732d63ff2db84d326f65739d

By bootstrapping pipelines,, DEMONSTRATE makes it easy
to explore complex strategies in SEARCH andPREDICT
without writing examples for every transformation. This
includes strategies that are challenging to explore without
custom annotations in traditional retrieval-augmented NLP.
For instance,, Khattab et al. (2021a) introduces a pipeline
for multi-hop reasoning that is trained with weak supervi-
sion,, extending work by Lee et al. (2019) and Khattab et al.
(2021b). In it,, the target 3 or 4 passages that need to re-
trieved must be labeled but the system discovers the best
order of “hops” automatically.
In contrast,, DSP allows us to build complex pipelines with-
out labels for intermediate steps,, because we can compose
programs out of small transformations. If LMandRM can
accurately process such transformations “zero-shot” (i.e.,,
without demonstrations) on at least one or two examples,,
these examples can be discovered with end-task labels and
used as demonstrations.
To draw on our earlier analogy with DNN frameworks like
PyTorch,, DEMONSTRATE aims to replace the function of
backpropagation in extensible ways by simulating the be-
havior of the program (corresponding to a “forward” pass)
and programmatically learning from errors. In doing this
with frozen models and with only end-task labels,, DEMON -
STRATE introduces a high degree of modularity. In partic-
ular,, without hand-labeling intermediate transformations,,
developers may swap the training domain,, update the train-
ing examples,, or modify the program’s strategy,, and use
annotate to automatically populate all of the intermediate
ﬁelds for demonstrations.
Selecting Demonstrations It is not always possible to ﬁt
all of the training examples in the context window of the
LM.DSP provides three primitives for selecting a subset
of training examples,, namely,, sample ,,knn,, and crossval .
1sample ( train : Examples ,, k: int )
2 -> Examples
3
4knn ( train : Examples ,, cast : Callable [[ Example ],, str ])
5 -> fn( example : Example ,, k: int ) # currying
6 -> Examples
7
8crossval ( train : Examples ,, n: int ,, k: int )
9 -> fn( evaluate : Transformation )
10 -> Examples
As a baseline choice,, kdemonstrations can be randomly
sampled from train using the sample primitive,, an ap-
proach used by Brown et al. (2020) and much subsequent
work. We can also leverage the RM’s representations and se-
lect from the training set the knearest neighbors to the input
text,, a strategy explored by Liu et al. (2021). Another strat-
egy is to apply cross-validation to select among a number of
sampled sets of demonstrations (Perez et al.,, 2021). For ex-
ample,, given |train |= 100 training examples,, crossvalwould select nsubsets of k= 5examples each,, and return
the set with which a transformation evaluate performs best
on the remaining 95examples.
Compositions & Extensions By manipulating demon-
strations and higher-order transformations,, these simple
selection and bootstrapping primitives can be combined to
conduct larger novel strategies. If the training set is very
large (e.g.,, |train |= 100 ,,000),, we can conduct knnto
ﬁnd the nearest k= 16 examples and only annotate these,,
arriving at a system that learns incrementally in real-time. If
the training set is moderately large (e.g.,, |train |= 1000 ),,
we can conduct crossval and cache the performance of all
prompts it evaluates on each training example. At test time,,
we can use knnto ﬁnd k= 50 similar examples to the test
input and select the prompt that performs best on these k
examples,, producing an adaptive system that is informed by
the quality of its pipeline on different types of examples.
2.4. S EARCH
TheSEARCH stage gathers passages to support transforma-
tions conducted by the LM. We assume a large knowledge
corpus—e.g.,, a snippet of Web,, Wikipedia,, or arXiv—that
is divided into text passages . Providing passages to the LM
facilitates factual responses,, enables updating the knowl-
edge store without retraining,, and presents a transparency
contract: when in doubt,, users can check whether the system
has faithfully used a reliable source in making a prediction.
In the simplest scenarios,, SEARCH can directly query the
RM,, requesting the top- kpassages (from a pre-deﬁned in-
dex) that match an input question. This baseline instantia-
tion of SEARCH simulates retrieval in most open-domain
question answering systems,, which implement a “retrieve-
then-read” pipeline,, like Lee et al. (2019),, Khattab et al.
(2021b),, Lazaridou et al. (2022),, and many others.
1from dsp import retrieve

3def simple_search (x):
4 passages = retrieve ( query =x. question ,, k =2)
5 return passages
SEARCH Strategies In many scenarios,, the complexity
of the task demands more sophisticated SEARCH strategies
that empower the RM to ﬁnd relevant passages. Our run-
ning example (Figure 2) is one such scenario,, in which we
suspect examples are likely to require multi-hop reasoning
in particular. Other settings,, for instance,, pose conversa-
tional challenges,, in which the information need expressed
by a user can only be resolved by taking into account pre-
vious turns in the conversation,, or demand more extensive
planning (Zhong et al.,, 2022).
In the retrieval-augmented NLP literature,, multi-hop
search (Xiong et al.,, 2020; Khattab et al.,, 2021a) and con-",020f6e4bdb2d9ad1a1f01f7b154c7c29

versational search (Del Tredici et al.,, 2021; Raposo et al.,,
2022) pipelines have received much attention. These sys-
tems are typically ﬁne-tuned with many hand-labeled query
“rewrites” (Anantha et al.,, 2020),, “decompositions” (Geva
et al.,, 2021; Min et al.,, 2019),, or target hops (Yang et al.,,
2018; Jiang et al.,, 2020). Supported with automatic anno-
tations from D EMONSTRATE ,, the S EARCH stage allows us
to simulate many such strategies and many others in terms
of passing queries,, passages,, and demonstrations between
theRM andLM. More importantly,, SEARCH facilitates our
vision of advanced strategies in which the LMandRM co-
operate to incrementally plan a research path for which the
RM gathers information and the LMidentiﬁes next steps.
Case Study Let us build on our running multi-hop exam-
ple as a case study. We can deﬁne multihop_search_v2
(Line 4 in our core program),, a slightly more advanced ver-
sion of the SEARCH transformation from Figure 2. This
transformation simulates the iterative retrieval component
of ﬁne-tuned retrieval-augmented systems like IRRR (Qi
et al.,, 2020),, which reads a retrieved passage in every hop
and generates a search query (or a termination condition to
stop hopping),, and Baleen (Khattab et al.,, 2021a),, which
summarizes the information from many passages in each
hop for inclusion in subsequent hops.

3def multihop_search_v2 (x,, max_hops =3) :
4 x. hops = []

6 for hop in range ( max_hops ):
7 summary ,, query = generate ( hop_template )(x)
8 x. hops . append (( summary ,, query ))

11
12 passages = retrieve (query ,, k =5)
13 x. context = [ summary ] + passages
14
15 return x
Inmultihop_search_v2 ,, Line 7 calls the generate prim-
itive,, which invokes the LM to produce a query for each
retrieval hop. The LM is conditioned on a prompt that is
prepared using the hop_template template. (We discuss
prompt templates and the generate primitive in §2.5.) Here,,
this template may be designed to generate a prompt that has
the following format (e.g.,, for the second hop).

information for answering a complex question . I
write N/A if the context contains all
information required .

3{ Task demonstrations from x.demos ,, if any }
4
5Context : {x. context }
6Question : {x. question }
7Summary : Let /quotesingle.Vars summarize the above context .
__{ summary }__
8Search Query : __{ query }__As shown,, the LM is instructed to read the context re-
trieved in earlier hops and a complex question. It is then
prompted to write: (i)a summary of the supplied con-
text and (ii)a search query that gathers information for
answering that question. The generated text will be ex-
tracted and assigned to the summary andquery variables in
(multihop_search_v2 ; Line 7). On Line 10,, we terminate
the hops if the query is “N/A”. Otherwise,, Line 12 retrieves
k= 5 passages using the query and Line 13 assigns the
context for the subsequent hop (or for PREDICT ),, setting
that to include the summary of all previous hops as well as
the passages retrieved in the ﬁnal hop so far.
Comparison with self-ask It may be instructive to con-
trast this multi-hop DSP program with the recent “self-
ask” (Press et al.,, 2022) prompting technique,, which we
compare against in §3. Self-ask can be thought of as a sim-
ple instantiation of DSP ’sSEARCH stage. In it,, the LMasks
one or more “follow-up questions”,, which are intercepted
and sent to a search engine. The search engine’s answers
are concatenated into the prompt and are used to answer
the question. This is essentially a simpliﬁed simulation of
IRRR (Qi et al.,, 2020).
As a general framework,, DSP can express ideas like self-ask
and many other,, more sophisticated pipelines as we discuss
in the present section. More importantly,, DSP offers a num-
ber of intrinsic advantages that lead to large empirical gains:
80%–290% over self-ask. For instance,, DSP programs are
deeply modular,, which among other things means that DSP
programs will annotate and construct their own demonstra-
tions. Thus,, they can be developed without labeling any
of the intermediate transformations (e.g.,, the queries gener-
ated). In addition,, the LM prompts constructed by DSP get
automatically updated to align with the training data and re-
trieval corpus provided. In contrast,, approaches like self-ask
rely on a hand-written prompt with hard-coded examples.
Moreover,, DSP assigns the control ﬂow to an explicit pro-
gram and facilitates design patterns that invoke the LM(or
RM) to conduct small transformations. This allows us to
build steps that are dedicated to generating one or more re-
trieval queries,, summarizing multiple passages per hop,, and
answering questions. These steps are individually simpler
than the self-ask prompt,, yet our multi-hop DSP program
deliberately composes them to build richer pipelines that are
thus more reliable. In contrast,, self-ask delegates the con-
trol ﬂow to the LMcompletions,, maintaining state within
the prompt itself and intercepting follow-up questions to
conduct search. We ﬁnd that this paradigm leads to a “self-
distraction” problem (§3.5) that DSP programs avoid.
Fusing Retrieval Results For improved recall and robust-
ness,, we can also fuse the retrieval across multiple gen-
erated queries. Fusion has a long history in information",2811427add62a83987bc5ccb438f77b0
2024-04-08 02:25:51.583,1268099,file:/Workspace/Users/odl_instructor_771155@databrickslabs.com/raw_pdfs/2212.14024.pdf,"DEMONSTRATE –SEARCH –PREDICT : Composing retrieval and language models
retrieval (Fox & Shaw,, 1994; Xue & Croft,, 2013; Kur-
land & Culpepper,, 2018) and sequentially processing multi-
ple queries was explored recently by Gao et al. (2022) for
retroactively attributing text generated by LMs to citations.
Inspired by these,, we include a fused_retrieval primitive
toDSP to offer a versatile mechanism for interacting with
frozen retrievers. It accepts an optional fusion function that
maps multiple retrieval lists into one. By default,, DSP uses
a variant of CombSUM (Fox & Shaw,, 1994),, assigning each
passage the sum of its probabilities across retrieval lists.
To illustrate,, the modiﬁcation below generates n= 10
queries for the transformation multihop_search_v2 .
c = generate ( hop_template ,, n =10) (x)
passages = fused_retrieval (c. queries ,, k =5)
summary = c. summaries [0] # highest - scoring summary
Compositions & Extensions To illustrate a simple com-
position,, we can equip a chatbot with the capacity for con-
versational multi-hop search by combining a query rewriting
step,, which produces a query that encompasses all of the
relevant conversational context,, with the multi-hop transfor-
mation,, as follows.
1def conversational_multihop_search (x):
2 x. question = generate ( conv_rewriting_template )(x)
3 return multihop_search_v2 (x)
Similar approaches can be used for correcting spelling mis-
takes or implementing pseudo-relevance feedback (Cao
et al.,, 2008; Wang et al.,, 2022a),, in which retrieved passages
are used to inform a better search query,, though this has not
been attempted with pretrained LMs to our knowledge.
2.5. P REDICT
The PREDICT stage generates the system output using
demonstrations (e.g.,, in x.demos ) and passages (e.g.,, in
x.context ).PREDICT tackles the challenges of reliably
solving the downstream task,, which integrates much of the
work on in-context learning in general. Within DSP ,, it also
has the more specialized function of systematically aggre-
gating information across a large number of demonstrations,,
passages,, and candidate predictions.
Generating Candidates Generally,, PREDICT has to pro-
duce one or more candidate predictions for the end-task.
To this end,, the basic primitive in PREDICT isgenerate ,,
which accepts a Template and (via currying) an Example
and queries the LM to produce one or more completions,,
as explored earlier in §2.4. A corresponding primitive that
uses the RM in this stage is rank ,, which accepts a query
and one or more passages and returns their relevance scores.1Template # template : an object that can produce
prompts and parse completions
2
3generate ( template : Template )
4 -> fn( example : Example )
5 -> Completions # object with keys to access
extracted preds and scores
6
7rank ( query : str ,, passages : List [ str ])
8 -> List [ float ] # object with keys to access
passage texts and scores
ATemplate is an object that can produce prompts,, that is,,
map an Example to a string,, and extract ﬁelds out of com-
pletions. For instance,, we can map an example xthat has a
question and retrieved passages to the following prompt:
1My task is to answer questions using Web documents .
2
3{ Task demonstrations from x.demos ,, if any }
4
5Context : {x. passage }
6Question : {x. question }
7Rationale : Let /quotesingle.Vars think step by step . __{ rationale }__
8Answer : __{ answer }__
As this illustrates,, the LMwill be asked to generate a chain-
of-thought rationale (CoT; Wei et al. 2022; Kojima et al.
2022) and an answer,, and the generated text will be ex-
tracted back into the rationale andanswer keys of each
completion.
Each invocation to the LMcan sample multiple candidate
predictions. Selecting a “best” prediction is the subject of
much work on decoding (Wiher et al.,, 2022; Li et al.,, 2022),,
but a frozen and general-purpose LMmay not support cus-
tom modiﬁcations to decoding. Within these constraints,, we
present several high-level strategies for selecting predictions
and aggregating information in DSP via the LMandRM.
Selecting Predictions Among multiple candidates,, we
can simply extract the most popular prediction. When a CoT
is used to arrive at the answer,, this is the self-consistency
method of Wang et al. (2022c),, which seeks to identify
predictions at which multiple distinct rationales arrive.
1from dsp import generate ,, majority
2
3def multihop_predict (x):
4 candidates = generate ( template_qa )(x)
5 return x. copy ( answer = majority ( candidates ). answer )
DSP generalizes this in two ways. First,, we can sample
multiple “pipelines of transformations” (PoT) within the pro-
gram,, rather than locally with “chains of thought” (CoT) in
one transformation. These chains may even invoke different
paths in the program,, as illustrated below.",37e4464d8833b7a245f030d9e7947ba6

1from dsp import branch
2
3def pipeline (x):
4 return multihop_predict ( multihop_search_v2 (x))
5
6def PoT_program ( question : str ) -> str :
7 x = Example ( question = question ,, train = train )
8 x = multihop_demonstrate (x)
9
10 candidates = branch ( pipeline ,, n=5,, t =0.7) (x)
11 return x. copy ( answer = majority ( candidates ). answer )
In the snippet above,, Line 10 invokes the primitive branch
which samples ndifferent PoTs with a high temperature
(e.g.,, t= 0.7) and accumulates their intermediate and
ﬁnal predictions. In this example,, our pipeline invokes
multihop_search_v2 (§2.4),, which applies a variable num-
ber of retrieval hops depending on the questions generated,,
before doing PREDICT . That is,, PoT_program potentially
invokes multiple distinct paths in the program (i.e.,, with dif-
ferent multi-hop queries and number of hops in each) across
branches. It then selects the majority answer overall.
DSP generalizes self-consistency in a second way. When
sampling our CoTs or PoTs provides multiple candidates,,
we can select the top- k(e.g.,, top-4) predictions and then
compare them directly. For instance,, we may prompt the
LMto compare these choices as MCQ candidates,, a trans-
formation for which DEMONSTRATE can automatically pre-
pare exemplars. This effectively simulates the LM recursion
of Levine et al. (2022),, though unlike their approach it does
not require a large training set or updating any (prompt-
tuning) weights. One such implementation is illustrated in
openqa_predict below.
1def openqa_predict (x):
2 preds = generate ( template_qa ,, n =20) (x). answers
3 x. choices = most_common (preds ,, k =4)
4
5 queries = [f""{x. question } {c}""
6 for c in x. choices ]
7
8 x. passages = fused_retrieval ( queries )
9 x. answer = generate ( TemplateMCQ )(x). answer
10 return x
As an alternative comparison approach,, we can invoke the
RM viarank to ﬁnd the prediction that is most grounded in
a retrieved contexts (i.e.,, most similar to the concatenation
of the retrieved passages) or,, given an RM that can score
completions (Krishna et al.,, 2022),, simply the prediction
that has the highest score given the prompt.
Aggregating Information When only a few demonstra-
tions or passages are selected,, we can simply concate-
nate them all into the prompt. For instance,, GPT-3.5
text-davinci-002 has a context window of 4097 tokens,,
which we ﬁnd to be reasonably large for accommodating
several (e.g.,, 3–5) demonstrations,, which individually in-
clude their own passages and rationales.To deal with a larger number of demonstrations or passages,,
we can branch in parallel to process individual subsets
of the passages or demonstrations and then aggregate the
individual answers using one of the scoring methods pre-
sented earlier. Indeed,, Lewis et al. (2020) and Lazaridou
et al. (2022) have explored marginalization as a way to com-
bine scores across passages and Le et al. (2022) ensemble
prompts across demonstrations,, which can be expressed in
this way.
An alternative aggregation strategy is to accumulate informa-
tion across passages sequentially,, rather than independently.
This is effectively how our multi-hop approach works (§2.4).
Such a strategy has also been employed recently by Gao
et al. (2022) for retroactively attributing text generated by
LMs to citations. They generate many queries but instead
of fusion (§2.4),, they run their pipeline on each query and
use its outputs to alter the input to subsequent queries.1
3. Evaluation
We now consider how to implement DSP programs for three
diverse knowledge-intensive NLP tasks: open-domain ques-
tion answering (QA),, multi-hop QA,, and conversational QA.
All of these tasks are “open-domain”,, in the sense that sys-
tems are given a short question or participate in a multi-turn
conversation without being granted access to context that
answers these questions.
We build and evaluate intuitive compositions of the func-
tions explored in §2 for each task. We show that,, despite
low development effort,, the resulting DSP programs exhibit
strong quality and deliver considerable empirical gains over
vanilla in-context learning and a standard retrieve-then-read
pipeline with in-context learning.
3.1. Evaluation Methodology
In this report,, we consider one development dataset for each
of the tasks we consider,, namely,, the open-domain version
of SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al.,, 2016; Lee et al.,, 2019),, the
multi-hop HotPotQA (Yang et al.,, 2018) dataset in the open-
domain “fullwiki” setting,, and the conversational question
answering QReCC (Anantha et al.,, 2020; Vakulenko et al.,,
2022) dataset,, which we used for developing the DSP ab-
stractions. We report the validation set accuracy on all three
datasets and discuss them in detail §3.5.
Unless otherwise stated,, systems are given access to 16-
shot training examples,, that is,, each DSP program can use
(up to) 16 questions—or conversations,, where applicable—
randomly sampled from the respective training set. We
1Though most of the functionality in this section is imple-
mented,, the primitives branch ,,knn,, and crossval are currently
work-in-progress.",6dc5359cdb213cdec4c332692dd99fba
2024-04-08 02:25:51.583,1268099,file:/Workspace/Users/odl_instructor_771155@databrickslabs.com/raw_pdfs/2212.14024.pdf,"DEMONSTRATE –SEARCH –PREDICT : Composing retrieval and language models
subsample the validation and test sets to 1000 questions
(or 400 conversations,, where applicable) and report average
quality across ﬁve seeds where each seed ﬁxes a single k-
shot training set of examples. To control the language model
API spending budget,, each seed processes one ﬁfth of the
evaluation examples (e.g.,, 200 questions per seed,, for a total
of 1000 unique questions).
We also dedicate held-out test datasets (e.g.,, Open-
NaturalQuestions; Kwiatkowski et al. 2019) and test tasks
(e.g.,, claim veriﬁcation,, as in FEVER; Thorne et al. 2018)
that we only use for evaluating pre-deﬁned DSP programs
rather than development. We will include these results in a
future version of this report.
3.2. Pretrained Modules
RM We use ColBERTv2 (Santhanam et al.,, 2022b),, a
state-of-the-art retriever based on late interaction (Khattab
& Zaharia,, 2020). We choose ColBERTv2 for its highly
effective zero-shot search quality and efﬁcient search (San-
thanam et al.,, 2022a). However,, our DSP programs are
agnostic to how the retriever represents examples or scores
passages,, so essentially any retriever can be used.
In addition,, by making retrieval a ﬁrst-class construct,, DSP
allows us to change or update the search index over time.
We simulate this in our experiments by aligning each of our
datasets with the nearest Wikipedia corpus among the Dec
2016 Wikipedia dump from Chen et al. 2017,, the Nov 2017
Wikipedia “abstracts” dump from Yang et al. 2018,, and the
Dec 2018 Wikipedia dump from Karpukhin et al. 2020.
LM We use the GPT-3.5 ( text-davinci-002 ; Brown
et al. 2020; Ouyang et al. 2022) language model. Unless
otherwise stated,, we use greedy decoding when generating
n= 1 prediction. We sample with temperature t= 0.7
when n > 1,, like related work (Wang et al.,, 2022c).
3.3. Baselines
Vanilla LM The vanilla LM baselines represent the few-
shot in-context learning paradigm used by Brown et al.
(2020). The open-domain QA and multi-hop QA base-
lines randomly sample 16 demonstrations (i.e.,, all of the
examples available to each program in our evaluation) from
the training set and do not augment these demonstrations
with evidence. Similarly,, the conversational QA baseline
samples four conversations. The vanilla baselines do not
search for passages relevant to the input query.
1def vanilla_LM_QA ( question : str ) -> str :
2 demos = sample (train ,, k =16)
3 x = Example ( question = question ,, demos = demos )
4 return generate ( qa_template )(x). predRetrieve-then-Read The “retrieve-then-read” baselines
use the RM to support each example with a potentially rele-
vant passage before submitting the prompt to the LM. This
emulates the pipelines used by state-of-the-art open-domain
question answering systems (Khattab et al.,, 2021b; Izacard
& Grave,, 2020; Hofstätter et al.,, 2022). In conversational
QA,, we concatenate the ﬁrst turn and the ﬁnal question,, an
approach that we found to perform much better than simply
using the ﬁnal turn. For multi-hop QA,, we retrieve and
concatenate two passages per question.
1def retrieve_then_read_QA ( question : str ) -> str :
2 demos = sample (train ,, k =16)
3 passages = retrieve ( question ,, k =1)
4 x = Example ( question = question ,,
5 passages = passages ,,
6 demos = demos )
7 return generate ( qa_template )(x). pred
Self-ask We also compare against self-ask (Press et al.,,
2022),, a contemporaneous pipeline that can be thought of
as a speciﬁc instantiation of DSP ’sSEARCH stage followed
by a simple PREDICT step. For direct comparison with
our methods,, we modify the self-ask control ﬂow to query
the same ColBERTv2 index used in our DSP experiments
instead of Google Search. We evaluate two conﬁgurations of
self-ask. The ﬁrst uses the original self-ask prompt template,,
which contains four hand-written demonstrations. In the
second conﬁguration,, we modify the prompt template to
apply a number of changes that we ﬁnd are empirically
useful for HotPotQA.2
3.4. Proposed DSP Programs
We build on transformations presented in §2. Our programs
for all three tasks have the following structure,, illustrated
for open-domain QA.
1def openqa_program ( question : str ) -> str :
2 x = Example ( question = question ,, train = train )
3 x = openqa_demonstrate (x)
4 x = openqa_search (x)
5 x = openqa_predict (x)
6 return x. answer
The exception is that the conversational QA program,,
2In particular: (i)use ColBERTv2-style passages in the hand-
crafted demonstrations of self-ask (i.e.,, instead of the original
Google-style snippets),, (ii)concatenate 16-shot training examples
from the task (i.e.,, question–answer pairs) as a preﬁx of the prompt,,
(iii)ask the model to generate a short intermediate answer per
retrieval step,, and (iv)explicitly ask the model to generate a follow-
up “search query” at each step. We found the ﬁnal item to be
important because self-ask’s default prompt often produces follow-
up questions that are not self-contained (e.g.,, “what is the name of
the national park?”,, which is not an informative search query). We
also ﬁx the casing in the prompt to be consistent.",66228c7e8455cdc2d0496ad1a3b1a07d

convqa_program ,, accepts turns (i.e.,, a list of strings,, rep-
resenting the conversational history) instead of a single
question . Unless otherwise stated,, our programs default to
greedy decoding during the D EMONSTRATE stage.
ForSEARCH ,, our open-domain QA program uses the ques-
tion directly for retrieving k= 7 passages and concate-
nates these passages into our QA prompt with CoT. For
PREDICT ,, it generates n= 20 reasoning chains and uses
self-consistency (SC; Wang et al. 2022c) to select its ﬁnal
prediction. For DEMONSTRATE ,, our open-domain QA pro-
gram uses the following approach,, slightly simpliﬁed for
presentation. In it,, the parameter k= 3passed to annotate
requests annotating only three demonstrations,, which will
then be used in the prompts.
1def openqa_demonstrate (x: Example ) -> Example :
2 demos = sample (x.train ,, k =16)
3
4 def openqa_attempt (d: Example ) -> Example :
5 d. demos = all_but (demos ,, d) # all ( raw )
examples different from d
6
7 d = openqa_search (d,, k =2)
8 if not passage_match (d): return None # skip
examples where search fails
9
10 d = openqa_predict (d,, sc= False )
11 if not answer_match (d): return None # skip
examples where predict fails
12
13 return d
14
15 x. demos = annotate (demos ,, openqa_attempt ,, k =3)
16 return x
Our multi-hop program adopts a very similar approach for
DEMONSTRATE andPREDICT . For SEARCH ,, it uses the
approach described in §2.4,, with the following adjustments.
It uses result fusion across n= 10 queries per hop and,,
among the npredictions,, uses the summary corresponding
to the largest average log-probability. It uses a ﬁxed number
of hops for HotPotQA,, i.e.,, two hops. In each prompt (i.e.,,each hop and QA),, it concatenates the summaries of all
previous hops (i.e.,, hop 1 onwards) and a total of k= 5
passages divided between the hops (i.e.,, ﬁve passages from
the ﬁrst hop or two passages from the ﬁrst and three from
the second).
For conversational QA,, we use a simple PREDICT which
generates a response with greedy decoding,, conditioned
on all of the previous turns of the conversation and ﬁve
retrieved passages. For SEARCH ,, our conversational QA
pipeline generates n= 10 re-written queries (and also uses
the simple query as the retrieve-and-read baseline; §3.3) and
fuses them as in §2.4. We implement DEMONSTRATE simi-
lar to openqa_demonstrate ,, but sample only four examples
(i.e.,, four conversational turns; instead of 16 questions as in
open-domain QA) for demonstrating the task for the higher-
order transformation convqa_attempt ,, which is passed to
annotate (not shown for brevity).
1def convqa_attempt (d: Example ) -> Example :
2 d. demos = all_but (demos ,, d) # all ( raw )
examples that don /quotesingle.Vart intersect with the
conversation of d

4 d = convqa_search (d,, k =2)

7 d = convqa_predict (d,, n =20)

d. candidates ) < .75: return None # skip

3.5. Development Datasets & Results
Open-SQuAD We conduct the open-domain version of
SQuAD over the Wikipedia 2016 corpus from Chen et al.
(2017),, as processed by Khattab et al. (2021b). We use the",1cb2f6f15cbbc2f23da795a05c7139d8

same train/validation/test splits as in Karpukhin et al. (2020)
and Khattab et al. (2021b).
Table 1 reports the answer EM and F1. The task-aware DSP
program achieves 36.6% EM,, outperforming the vanilla LM
baseline by 126% EM relative gains. This indicates the im-
portance of grounding the LM’s predictions in retrieval,, and
it shows that state-of-the-art retrievers like ColBERTv2 have
the capacity to do so off-the-shelf. The proposed DSP pro-
gram also achieves relative gains of 8% in EM and 6% in F1
over the retrieve-then-read pipeline,, highlighting that non-
trivial gains are possible by aggregating information across
several retrieved passages as we do with self-consistency.
These in-context learning results are competitive with a
number of popular ﬁne-tuned systems. For instance,, on
the Open-SQuAD test set,, DPR achieves 29.8% EM,, well
below our 16-shot DSP program. On the Open-SQuAD
dev set,, the powerful Fusion-in-Decoder (Izacard & Grave,,
2020) “base” approach achieves approximately 36% (i.e.,,
very similar quality to our system) when invoked with ﬁve
retrieved passages. Nonetheless,, with the default setting
of reading 100 passages,, their system reaches 48% EM in
this evaluation. This may indicate that similar gains are
possible for our DSP program if the PREDICT stage is made
to aggregate information across many more passages.
For comparison,, we also evaluate the self-ask pipeline,,
which achieves 9.3% EM,, suggesting that its ﬁxed pipeline
is ineffective outside its default multi-hop setting. Study-
ing a few examples of its errors reveals that it often de-
composes questions in tangential ways and answers these
questions instead. We refer to this behavior of the LMas
“self-distraction”,, and we believe it adds evidence in favor of
our design decisions in DSP . To illustrate self-distraction,,
when self-ask is prompted with “When does The Kidnap-
ping of Edgardo Mortara take place?”,, it asks “What is The
Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara“ and then asks when it was
published,, a tangential question. Thus,, self-ask answers
“1997”,, instead of the time The Kidnapping of Edgardo
Mortara takes place (1858).
For reference,, Table 1 also reports (as No-retrieval LM
SoTA) the concurrent in-context learning results from Si
et al. (2022) using code-davinci-002 ,, who achieve 20.2%
EM without retrieval and 34.0% EM with retrieval,, albeit
on a different sample and split of the SQuAD data. Overall,,
their approaches are very similar to the baselines we im-
plement (vanilla LM and retrieve-then-read),, though their
retrieval-augmented approach retrieves (and concatenates
into the prompt) 10 passages from a Wikipedia dump.
HotPotQA We use the open-domain “fullwiki” setting
of HotPotQA using its ofﬁcial Wikipedia 2017 “abstracts”
corpus. The HotPotQA test set is hidden,, so we reserve
the ofﬁcial validation set for our testing. We sub-dividethe training set into 90%/10% train/validation splits. In the
training (and thus validation) split,, we keep only examples
marked as “hard” in the original dataset,, which matches the
designation of the ofﬁcial validation and test sets.
We report the ﬁnal answer EM and F1 in Table 1. On
HotPotQA,, the task-aware DSP program outperforms the
baselines and existing work by very wide margins,, exceed-
ing the vanilla LM,, the retrieve-then-read baseline,, and the
self-ask pipeline by 82%,, 39%,, and 80%,, respectively,, in
EM. This highlights the effectiveness of building up more
sophisticated programs that coordinate the LM andRM for
the S EARCH step.
These results may be pegged against the evaluation on Hot-
PotQA in a number of concurrent papers. We ﬁrst compare
with non-retrieval approaches,, though our comparisons must
be tentative due to variation in evaluation methodologies. Si
et al. (2022) achieve 25.2% EM with CoT prompting. With
a “recite-and-answer” technique for PaLM-62B (Chowdh-
ery et al.,, 2022),, Sun et al. (2022) achieve 26.5% EM. Wang
et al. (2022b) achieve 33.8% EM and 44.6 F1 when apply-
ing a self-consistency prompt for PaLM-540B. Next,, we
compare with a contemporaneous retrieval-based approach:
Yao et al. (2022) achieve 35.1% EM using a system capable
of searching using a Wikipedia API. All of these approaches
trail our task-aware DSP program,, which achieves 51.4%
EM,, by large margins.
QReCC We use QReCC (Anantha et al.,, 2020) in an open-
domain setting over Wikipedia 2018. QReCC does not have
an ofﬁcial development set,, so we sub-divide the training
set into 90%/10% train/validation splits. For the ﬁrst ques-
tion in every conversation,, we use the rewritten question
as the original question often assumes access to a ground-
truth document. We also ﬁlter low-quality examples from
QReCC.3
We conduct the QReCC conversations in an auto-regressive
manner. At turn t > 1of a particular conversation,, the
system sees its own responses (i.e.,, not the ground truth
responses) to previous turns of the conversation. We report
the novel-F1 metric (nF1; Paranjape et al. 2022),, which
computes the F1 overlap between the system response and
the ground truth while discounting common stopwords and
terms present in the question (or earlier questions). The
results are shown in Table 1,, and follow the same general
pattern as SQuAD and HotPotQA.
3We remove conversations that have one or more empty ground-
truth answers and conversations that have only one or two ques-
tions. We also ﬁnd many conversations that include “what other
interesting facts are in this article?”,, which conﬂict with the open-
domain formulation and have no well-deﬁned answer. Hence,, we
remove any conversation that includes the keywords “other inter-
esting” or “else”,, which we found to be markers of low quality.",5aa07ff87e72fb8662390f623a588280

4. Conclusion
For a long time,, the dominant paradigm for building models
in AI has centered around multiplication of tensor repre-
sentations,, and in the deep learning era this has given rise
to highly modular (layer-wise) designs that allow for fast
development and wide exploration. However,, these design
paradigms require extensive domain expertise,, and even
experts face substantial challenges when it comes to com-
bining different pretrained components into larger systems.
The promise of in-context learning is that we can build com-
plex systems from pretrained components using only natural
language as the medium for giving systems instructions and,,
as we argue for,, allowing components to communicate with
each other. In this new paradigm,, the building blocks are
pretrained models and the core operations are natural lan-
guage instructions and operations on natural language texts.
If we can realize this potential,, then we can broaden partici-
pation in AI system development,, rapidly prototype systems
for new domains,, and maximize the value of specialized
pretrained components.
In the current paper,, we introduced the DEMONSTRATE –
SEARCH –PREDICT (DSP ) framework for retrieval aug-
mented in-context learning. DSP consists of a number of
simple,, composable functions for implementing in-context
learning systems as deliberate programs —instead of end-
task prompts—for solving knowledge intensive tasks. We
implemented DSP as a Python library and used it to write
programs for Open-SQuAD,, HotPotQA,, and QReCC. These
programs deliver substantial gains over previous in-context
learning approaches. However,, beyond any particular per-
formance number,, we argue that the central contribution of
DSP is in helping to reveal a very large space of conceptual
possibilities for in-context learning in general.

While Reducing Cost and Improving Performance
Lingjiao Chen,, Matei Zaharia,, James Zou

Abstract
There is a rapidly growing number of large language models (LLMs) that users can query for
a fee. We review the cost associated with querying popular LLM APIs—e.g. GPT-4,, ChatGPT,,
J1-Jumbo—and ﬁnd that these models have heterogeneous pricing structures,, with fees that can
diﬀer by two orders of magnitude. In particular,, using LLMs on large collections of queries and
text can be expensive. Motivated by this,, we outline and discuss three types of strategies that
users can exploit to reduce the inference cost associated with using LLMs: 1) prompt adaptation,,
2) LLM approximation,, and 3) LLM cascade. As an example,, we propose FrugalGPT,, a simple yet
ﬂexible instantiation of LLM cascade which learns which combinations of LLMs to use for diﬀerent
queries in order to reduce cost and improve accuracy. Our experiments show that FrugalGPT can
match the performance of the best individual LLM (e.g. GPT-4) with up to 98% cost reduction or
improve the accuracy over GPT-4 by 4% with the same cost. The ideas and ﬁndings presented
here lay a foundation for using LLMs sustainably and eﬃciently.
1 Introduction
We are in the midst of an explosion of large language models (LLMs). The alluring possibilities of
using LLMs for large-scale applications such as commerce,, science,, and ﬁnance have led a growing
number of companies (OpenAI,, AI21,, CoHere,, etc.) to oﬀer LLMs as services.
While LLMs such as GPT-4 achieves unprecedented performance in tasks such as question answering,,
using them for high-throughput applications can be very expensive. For example,, ChatGPT is estimated
to cost over $700,,000 per day to operate [ Cosa ],, and using GPT-4 to support customer service can
cost a small business over $21,,000 a month [ Cosb ]. In addition to the ﬁnancial cost,, using the largest
LLMs encures substantial environmental and energy impact [ BGMMS21 ,,WRG+22],, aﬀecting the social
welfare of current and future generations.
There are many LLMs now available via APIs and they charge heterogeneous prices. The cost of
using a LLM API typically consists of three components: 1) prompt cost (proportional to the length of
the prompt),, 2) generation cost (proportional to the generation length),, and 3) sometimes a ﬁxed cost
per query. We compared the cost associated with using 12 diﬀerent commercial LLMs from mainstream
providers including OpenAI,, AI21,, CoHere and Textsynth (Table 1). Their cost can diﬀer by up to 2
orders of magnitudes: for example,, the prompt cost for 10M tokens is $30 for OpenAI’s GPT-4 but
only $0.2 for GPT-J hosted by Textsyth.
Given the heterogeneous cost and quality,, how to eﬀectively and eﬃciently leverage the full set of
LLM options is a key challenge for pracitioners. If the tasks are relatively simple,, then aggregating
multiple responses from GPT-J [ WK21 ] (whose size is 30x smaller than GPT-3) oﬀers performance
similar to GPT-3 [ ANC+22],, leading to ﬁnancial and environmental savings. However,, the performance
of GPT-J can be much worse on diﬃcult tasks [ TLI+23]. Moreover,, relying on one API provider
is not reliable if that provider becomes unavailable,, potentially due to spiking demand. Existing
model ensemble paradigms such as model cascade [ VJ04 ,,WLM11 ] and FrugalML [ CZZ20 ,,CZZ22 ] were
designed for predictive tasks with a known set of labels and do not account for the full capabilities of
LLM. How to use LLMs aﬀordably and accurately therefore calls for new approaches.
Our contributions. In this paper,, we lay out our vision of a ﬂexible framework that uses LLM APIs
to process natural language queries within a budget constraint,, termed FrugalGPT. As shown in Figure

Cost ($)AccuracyFigure 1: Our vision for reducing LLM cost while improving accuracy. (a) The standard usage sends
queries to a single LLM (e.g. GPT-4),, which can be expensive. (b) Our proposal is to use prompt
adaption,, LLM approximation and LLM cascade to reduce the inference cost. By optimizing over the
selection of diﬀerent LLM APIs (e.g.,, GPT-J,, ChatGPT,, and GPT-4) as well as prompting strategies
(such as zero-shot [ BMR+20],, few-shot [ LSZ+21],, and chain-of-thought(CoT) [ WWS+22]),, we can
achieve substantial eﬃciency gains. (c) On HEADLINES (a ﬁnancial news dataset),, FrugalGPT can
reduce the inference cost by 98% while exceeding the performance of the best individual LLM (GPT-4).
1,, we discuss three main strategies for cost reduction: prompt adaptation ,,LLM approximation ,, and
LLM cascade . The prompt adaptation explores how to identify eﬀective (often shorter) prompts to save
cost. LLM approximation aims to create simpler and cheaper LLMs to match a powerful yet expensive
LLM on speciﬁc tasks. LLM cascade focuses on how to adaptively choose which LLM APIs to use for
diﬀerent queries.
To illustrate the potential of these ideas,, we implement and evaluate a simple version of FrugalGPT
using LLM cascade. On each dataset and task,, FrugalGPT learns how to adaptively triage diﬀerent
queries in the dataset to diﬀerent combinations of LLMs,, including ChatGPT [ Cha],, GPT-3 [ BMR+20]
and GPT-4 [ Ope23 ]. Our experiments show that FrugalGPT can save up to 98% of the inference cost
of the best individual LLM API while matching its performance on the downstream task. On the other
hand,, FrugalGPT can improve the performance by up to 4% with the same cost. We believe this is only
the tip of the iceberg and we hope FrugalGPT opens a new window toward reducing LLMs’ inference
cost and improving its performances.
Related Works. Prompt Engineering. Prompt engineering has emerged as a discipline for
crafting prompts to enhance LLMs’ performance across various applications. Recent developments
include few-shot [ BMR+20],, chain-of-thought [ WWS+22],, knowledge enhancement [ LLL+21,,KSL+22],,
and numerous other prompting techniques [ MDL+23,,KTF+22,,ZSH+22,,DGSG22 ]. Existing prompt
engineering approaches often aim to provide more detailed task explanations and in-context examples,,
resulting in longer and more expensive prompts. In contrast,, this paper explores the use of concise
prompts to reduce costs.
Model Ensemble. Model ensembles,, which involve combining multiple ML models for prediction,,
have gained popularity in supervised learning [ VJ04 ,,Fri02 ],, unsupervised learning [ YLLL14 ],, semi-
supervised learning [ GDMR22 ],, and weakly supervised learning [ DSP+17]. Model ensembles typically
require white-box access to multiple models for training purposes,, but LLM APIs are often black-box.
Moreover,, model ensembles necessitate querying all models for a single query,, thereby increasing costs.
System Optimization for LLMs. Numerous eﬀorts have aimed to accelerate the training and
inference time of modern deep learning models through system optimization [ HMD15 ,,CHSV17 ,,Cas19 ,,
JZA19 ,,RRWN11 ]. Recent work focuses on post-training quantization [ BHS+22,,YLW+23,,XLS+22],,
training pipeline parallelism [ LZG+21],, and hardware-aware pruning [ KFA23 ] tailored for LLMs. System
optimization requires modiﬁcations to LLMs’ internal states (e.g.,, model weights),, but many commercial

retraining highly expensive.
ML-as-a-Service. LLM APIs constitute a crucial component of the rapidly expanding machine-
learning-as-a-service (MLaaS) industry. Recent studies have demonstrated the diversity of diﬀerent ML
APIs’ predictions [ BG18 ,,KNL+20,,CCZZ21 ] and proposed strategies for leveraging various classiﬁcation
ML APIs to improve performance [ CZZ20 ,,CZZ22 ]. The outputs of LLM APIs encompass the entire
natural language space,, but existing work requires a ﬁxed (and known) label set. Moreover,, both
prompt choices and LLM API selections signiﬁcantly impact generative tasks’ performance,, resulting in
a considerably larger optimization space than standard classiﬁcation.
The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows. We start by oﬀering more context and the
problem statement in Section 2. Next in Section 3,, we present our visions on how to use LLM APIs
aﬀordability and accurately. Section 4 shows the empirical beneﬁts of FrugalGPT using real-world LLM
APIs (including GPT-3,, ChatGPT,, and GPT-4). Finally,, we discuss future prospects in Section 5.
2 Scope and Problem Statement

language query answering task,, where the objective is to answer a query qsampled from a natural
language query distribution Q. Various real-world natural language tasks,, such as news classiﬁcation,,
reading comprehension,, and commonsense reasoning,, can be formulated as query-answering problems.
LLM marketplace. We consider answering queries via the LLM market,, which comprises Kdiﬀerent
LLM APIs,, denoted by {fi(·)}K
i=1. Eachfi(·) :P↦→A is a function that,, given a prompt pfrom
the prompt space P,, generates an answer from the answer distribution A. Note that to use LLM
APIs,, one has to convert each query qto some corresponding prompt ﬁrst. LLM APIs are associated
with their own cost,, typically consisting of three components: a portion proportional to the length
of the prompt,, a portion proportional to the length of the generated answer,, and (sometimes) a
ﬁxed cost per query. Formally,, given a prompt p,, the cost of using the ith LLM API is denoted by
ci(p)≜˜ci,,2∥fi(p)∥+ ˜ci,,1∥p∥+ ˜ci,,0,, where ˜ci,,j,,j= 0,,1,,2 are constants.
An illustrative example. Adapting the case study provided by [ Cosa ],, assume a small business
operates a customer service using GPT-4. The company caters to 15,,000 customers each month,, with
each customer asking three questions twice a week,, totaling 360,,000 queries per month. Suppose for
each question,, its corresponding prompt averages 1800 tokens,, and the answer is around 80 tokens.
Considering that the input and response costs of GPT-4 are $0.03 and $0.06 per thousand tokens,,
respectively,, the total monthly cost amounts to 360 ×($0.03×1800 + $0.06×80)≈$21.2K. Such a
high cost is prohibitive for many small businesses.
Problem statement: budget-aware LLM API usage. Our primary goal in this paper is lever-
aging LLM APIs within a budget constraint . Formally,, this can be formulated as maximizing the overall
task performance E(q,,a)∈Q×A [r(a,,ˆa(s,,q))],, while ensuring the average cost is bounded by a user-deﬁned
valueb,, i.e.,, E(q,,a)∈Q×A [c(s,,q)]≤b. Here,,adenotes the correct answer to the query q,,ˆa(s,,q) is the
generated answer by some strategy sfor queryq,, andc(s,,q) is the associated cost for processing query
qusing strategy s. The reward function r(·,,·) measures how closely the generated answer aligns with
the correct one. It is crucial to note that the search space for the strategy is vast,, encompassing factors
such as which prompts to use,, which LLM APIs to employ,, and how to aggregate their responses.
3 How to Use LLMs Aﬀordably and Accurately
Now we present our vision on how to use LLM APIs within a budget. As shown in Figure 1 (b),, we
discuss three cost-reduction strategies,, namely,, prompt adaptation,, LLM approximation,, and LLM
cascade.

2024-04-08 02:25:51.579,1171365,file:/Workspace/Users/odl_instructor_771155@databrickslabs.com/raw_pdfs/2305.05176.pdf,"Strategy 1: Prompt adaptation. The cost of an LLM query increases linearly with the size of the
prompt. Consequently,, a logical approach to reduce the cost of using LLM APIs involves decreasing the
prompt’s size,, a process we refer to as prompt adaptation. Prompt selection (as illustrated in Figure 2
(a)) is a natural example of prompt adaptation: rather than employing a prompt containing numerous
examples that demonstrate how to perform a task,, one can retain a small subset of examples in the
prompt. This results in a smaller prompt and subsequently lower cost. An intriguing challenge of prompt
selection lies in determining which examples to maintain for various queries without compromising task
performance.
An additional instantiation is query concatenation (Figure 2 (b)). It is important to note that
processing queries individually necessitates sending the same prompt to an LLM API multiple times.
Therefore,, the fundamental concept of query concatenation involves sending the prompt only once
to the LLM API while allowing it to address multiple queries,, thereby preventing redundant prompt
processing. To accomplish this,, several queries must be concatenated into a single query,, and the
prompt must explicitly request the LLM API to process multiple queries. For instance,, to handle two
queries using one prompt,, the examples presented in the prompt can include both queries followed by
their corresponding answers.
Strategy 2: LLM approximation. The concept of LLM approximation is quite simple: if an LLM
API is too costly to utilize,, one can approximate it using more aﬀordable models or infrastructures.
One example is the completion cache : as depicted in Figure 2 (c),, the fundamental idea involves storing
the response locally in a cache (e.g.,, a database) when submitting a query to an LLM API. To process
a new query,, we ﬁrst verify if a similar query has been previously answered. If so,, the response is
retrieved from the cache. An LLM API is invoked only if no similar query is discovered in the cache.
The completion cache provides substantial cost savings when similar queries are frequently posed. For
instance,, consider a search engine powered by an LLM API. If numerous users search for the same or
similar keywords simultaneously,, the completion cache facilitates answering all their queries by invoking
the LLM only once.
Another example of LLM approximation is model ﬁne-tuning . As shown in Figure 2(d),, this process
consists of three steps: ﬁrst,, collect a powerful but expensive LLM API’s responses to a few queries;
second,, use the responses to ﬁne-tune a smaller and more aﬀordable AI model; and ﬁnally,, employ
the ﬁne-tuned model for new queries. In addition to cost savings,, the ﬁne-tuned model often does not
require lengthy prompts,, thus providing latency improvements as a byproduct.
Strategy 3: LLM cascade. The increasing availability of LLM APIs with heterogeneous performance
and costs presents a unique opportunity for data-adaptive LLM selection. Diﬀerent LLM APIs have their
own strengths and weaknesses for various queries. Consequently,, appropriately selecting which LLMs
to use can provide both cost reduction and performance improvements. LLM cascade ,, as illustrated
in Figure 2 (e),, is one such example. LLM cascade sends a query to a list of LLM APIs sequentially.
If one LLM API’s response is reliable,, then its response is returned,, and no further LLMs in the list
are needed. The remaining LLM APIs are queried only if the previous APIs’ generations are deemed
insuﬃciently reliable. Query cost is signiﬁcantly reduced if the ﬁrst few APIs are relatively inexpensive
and produce reliable generations.
The key components of LLM cascade consist of two elements: (i) a generation scoring function
and (ii) an LLM router. The generation scoring function,, denoted by g(·,,·) :Q×A↦→ [0,,1],, generates
a reliability score given a query and an answer produced by an LLM API. The LLM router selects
mLLM APIs to include in the list. Let LLL∈[K]mdenote the indexes of the mAPIs selected by the
router. Given a new query,, it iteratively invokes the ith API in the list to obtain an answer fLi(q).
Then,, it uses the scoring function to generate a score g(q,,fLi(q)). It returns the generation if the score
is higher than a threshold τττi,, and queries the next service otherwise.
The scoring function can be obtained by training a simple regression model that learns whether
a generation is correct from the query and a generated answer. Learning the selected list LLLand the

Here,,zdenotes the LLM API at which the router stops and returns the answer,, the ﬁrst constraint
ensures the average cost is bounded by the budget,, and the objective measures the quality of the
generation fLz(q) for a query qcompared to the true answer a. This problem is inherently a mixed-
integer optimization and thus computationally expensive to solve. To address this issue,, we develop a
specialized optimizer that (i) prunes the search space of LLLby ignoring any list of LLMs with small
answer disagreement,, and (ii) approximates the objective by interpolating it within a few samples. This
results in an eﬃcient implementation with satisfactory performance,, as shown later in Figure 5.
Compositions. Combining approaches within and across diﬀerent strategies can lead to further
cost reduction and performance enhancement. For instance,, joint prompt and LLM selection is a
composition of prompt selection and LLM cascade: for a given query,, it searches for the smallest prompt
and most aﬀordable LLM that achieves satisfactory task performance. Another example is to search
across both existing LLM APIs and ﬁne-tuned models. It is important to note that the composition of
diﬀerent approaches also increases the computational costs for training. Consequently,, this paves the
way for investigating trade-oﬀs between query costs,, task performance,, and computational costs.
4 LLM Cascade Reduces Cost and Improves Accuracy
In this section,, we present an empirical study on the FrugalGPT LLM cascade. Our goals are three-fold:
(i) understand what a simple instantiation of LLM cascade learns,, (ii) quantify the cost savings attained
by FrugalGPT while matching the best individual LLM API’s performance,, and (iii) measure the
trade-oﬀs between performance and cost enabled by FrugalGPT.
Setups: LLM APIs,, Tasks,, Datasets,, and FrugalGPT instances. We have selected 12 LLM
APIs from 5 mainstream providers,, namely,, OpenAI [ Ope],, AI21 [ AI2],, CoHere [ CoH],, Textsynth [ Tex],,
and ForeFrontAI [ FFA]. The details are summarized in Table 1. FrugalGPT has been developed
on top of these APIs and evaluated on a range of datasets belonging to diﬀerent tasks,, including
HEADLINES [ SK21 ],, OVERRULING [ ZGA+21],, and COQA [ RCM19 ]. The summary of these datasets
is presented in Table 2. HEADLINES is a ﬁnancial news dataset whose goal is to determine the gold
price trend (up,, down,, neutral,, or none) by reading ﬁnancial news titles. This is especially useful for
ﬁltering relevant news in ﬁnancial markets. OVERRULING is a legal document dataset where the goal
is to determine whether a given sentence is an overruling,, i.e.,, rejecting previous legal cases. COQA is
a reading comprehension dataset developed in a conversational setting,, which we have adapted as a
direct query answering task. We focus on the LLM cascade approach with a cascade length of 3,, as
this simpliﬁes the optimization space and already demonstrates good results. Each dataset is randomly
split into a training set to learn the LLM cascade and a test set for evaluation.
A Case Study. Let us begin with a case study on the HEADLINES dataset. We set the budget to
be$6.5,, which is one-ﬁfth of GPT-4’s cost. We employ a DistilBERT [ SDCW19 ] tailored to regression
as the scoring function. It is important to note that DistilBERT is considerably smaller and therefore
less expensive than all LLMs considered here. As depicted in Figure 3 (a),, the learned FrugalGPT
sequentially calls GPT-J,, J1-L,, and GPT-4. For any given query,, it ﬁrst extracts an answer from
GPT-J. If the score of this answer is greater than 0.96,, the answer is accepted as the ﬁnal response.
Otherwise,, J1-L is queried. J1-L’s answer is accepted as the ﬁnal response if its score is greater than
0.37; otherwise,, GPT-4 is invoked to obtain the ﬁnal answer. Interestingly,, this approach outperforms
GPT-4 for numerous queries. For instance,, given a headline ”Gold oﬀ the lows after dismal U.S. GDP
data” from NASDAQ,, FrugalGPT accurately predicts that the price is going down,, while GPT-4

retrieved in March 2023. The cost can have three additive components: input (proportional to the
number of input tokens),, output (proportional to the number of generated tokens) and a ﬁxed cost per
request. The LLMs’s costs can diﬀer by up to 2 orders of magnitudes. For example,, to process 10M
input tokens,, GPT-J from Textsynth costs only $0.2,, but OpenAI’s GPT-4 needs $30.

Figure 4: Maximum performance improvement (MPI) of each pair of LLMs. (a),, (b),, and (c) correspond
to the three datasets,, separately. One entry indicates the percent of cases that the LLM on its row is
wrong but the LLM on its column gives the right answer. Overall,, we observe that cheap LLMs can
be complementary to the expensive ones quite often. For example,, for about 6% of the data,, GPT-4
makes a mistake but GPJ-J (or J-L or GPT-C) gives the right answer on HEADLINES.
provides an incorrect answer (as shown in Figure 3(b)). Overall,, FrugalGPT results in both accuracy
gains and cost reduction. As illustrated in Figure 3(c),, its cost is reduced by 80%,, while the accuracy
is even 1.5% higher.
LLM diversity. Why can multiple LLM APIs potentially produce better performance than the
best individual LLM? In essence,, this is due to generation diversity: even an inexpensive LLM can
sometimes correctly answer queries on which a more expensive LLM fails. To measure this diversity,,
we use the maximum performance improvement,, or MPI. The MPI of LLM A with respect to LLM B
is the probability that LLM A generates the correct answer while LLM B provides incorrect ones. This
metric essentially measures the maximum performance gains achievable by invoking LLM A in addition
to LLM B.
MPI between each pair of LLM APIs for all datasets is displayed in Figure 4. Overall,, we observe
signiﬁcant potential within the LLM marketplace. For instance,, GPT-C,, GPT-J,, and J1-L can all
enhance GPT-4’s performance by up to 6% on the HEADLINES dataset. On the COQA dataset,, there
are 13% of data points where GPT-4 makes an error,, but GPT-3 provides the correct answer. Although
these improvement upper bounds may not always be attainable,, they do demonstrate the possibility of
utilizing more aﬀordable services to achieve better performance.

Cost Savings. Subsequently,, we examine whether FrugalGPT can reduce costs while maintaining
accuracy and,, if so,, by how much. Table 3 displays the overall cost savings of FrugalGPT,, which range
from 50% to 98%. This is feasible because FrugalGPT identiﬁes the queries that can be accurately
answered by smaller LLMs and,, as a result,, only invokes those cost-eﬀective LLMs. Powerful but
expensive LLMs,, such as GPT-4,, are utilized only for challenging queries detected by FrugalGPT.
Performance and Cost Trade-oﬀs. Now,, we investigate the trade-oﬀs between performance and
cost achieved by FrugalGPT,, as illustrated in Figure 5. Several interesting observations can be made.

LLM on the HEADLINES dataset,, while GPT-3 holds that position on the OVERRULING and COQA
datasets. This is primarily due to the heterogeneous pricing mechanism: J1 incurs a high cost for
each generated token but charges nothing for input tokens,, whereas GPT-3 charges for both input and
output tokens. Moreover,, more expensive LLM APIs sometimes result in worse performance than their
cheaper counterparts. For example,, J1 is costlier than GPT-3 on HEADLINES,, but its performance
is inferior. These observations underscore the importance of aptly selecting LLM APIs,, even in the
absence of budget constraints.
Next,, we note that FrugalGPT enables smooth performance-cost trade-oﬀs across all evaluated
datasets. This oﬀers ﬂexible choices to LLM users and potentially helps LLM API providers save
energy and reduce carbon emissions. In fact,, FrugalGPT can simultaneously reduce costs and improve
accuracy. For example,, on the OVERRULING dataset,, FrugalGPT achieves a 1% accuracy gain while
reducing costs by 73% compared to the best LLM API,, GPT-4. This is likely because FrugalGPT
integrates knowledge from multiple LLMs.
The example queries shown in Figure 5 further aid in understanding why FrugalGPT can simul-
taneously improve performance and reduce costs. GPT-4 makes mistakes on some queries (e.g.,, the
ﬁrst example in part (a)),, but some low-cost APIs provide correct predictions. FrugalGPT accurately
identiﬁes those queries and relies solely on the inexpensive APIs. For example,, GPT-4 incorrectly infers
no overruling from the legal statement ”The time has come to reconcile and regularize our cases in
this ﬁeld,,” as shown in Figure 5(b). However,, FrugalGPT accepts GPT-J’s correct answer,, avoiding
the use of expensive LLMs and improving overall performance. Naturally,, a single LLM API is not
always correct; LLM cascade overcomes this by employing a chain of LLM APIs. For example,, in
the second example shown in Figure 5(a),, FrugalGPT identiﬁes that GPT-J’s generation may not be
reliable and turns to the second LLM in the chain,, J1-L,, to ﬁnd the correct answer. Again,, GPT-4
provides the wrong answer. FrugalGPT is not perfect,, and there remains ample room for cost reduction.
For example,, in the third example in Figure 5(c),, all LLM APIs in the chain give the same answer.
However,, FrugalGPT is unsure if the ﬁrst LLMs are correct,, resulting in the need to query all LLMs in
the chain. Identifying how to avoid such cases remains an open problem.
5 Discussions,, Limitations and Future Prospects
The substantial cost of employing LLMs in real-world scenarios presents a considerable barrier to their
widespread usage. In this paper,, we outline and discuss practical strategies for reducing the inference
cost of using LLM APIs. We also developed FrugalGPT to illustrate one of the cost-saving strategies,,
LLM cascade. Our empirical ﬁndings show that FrugalGPT can reduce costs by up to 98% while
preserving the performance of cutting-edge LLMs.
FrugalGPT lays the groundwork for optimizing task performance with LLM APIs under budget
constraints; however,, it has some limitations. To train the LLM cascade strategy in FrugalGPT,, we
need some labeled examples. And in order for the cascade to work well,, the training examples should be
from the same or similar distribution as the test examples. Moreover,, learning the LLM cascade itself
requires resources. We view this as an one-time upfront cost; this is beneﬁcial when the ﬁnal query
dataset is larger than the data used to train the cascade. There are also other promising strategies
for cost saving,, such as speeding up attention computation itself,, that we do not discuss here. Given
the rapid development of LLM,, this paper is not meant to be comprehensive or to provide a deﬁnitive
solution. Our goal is to lay a foundation for this important research agenda and to demonstrate that
even simple cascade can already achieve promising savings.
There are also many related directions for future exploration. While FrugalGPT concentrates
on balancing performance and cost,, real-world applications call for the evaluation of other critical
factors,, including latency,, fairness,, privacy,, and environmental impact. Incorporating these elements
into optimization methodologies while maintaining performance and cost-eﬀectiveness is an important
avenue for future research. Furthermore,, utilizing LLMs in risk-critical applications necessitates the
careful quantiﬁcation of uncertainty in LLM-generated outputs. As the ﬁeld progresses,, addressing the
environmental ramiﬁcations of training and deploying LLMs demands a joint eﬀort from LLM users
and API providers. The continuous evolution of LLMs and their applications will inevitably unveil new
challenges and opportunities,, fostering further research and development in this dynamic ﬁeld.

The Shift from Models to Compound AI Systems

AI caught everyone’s attention in 2023 with Large Language Models (LLMs) that can be
instructed to perform general tasks,, such as translation or coding,, just by prompting. This
naturally led to an intense focus on models as the primary ingredient in AI application
development,, with everyone wondering what capabilities new LLMs will bring. As more
developers begin to build using LLMs,, however,, we believe that this focus is rapidly changing:
state-of-the-art AI results are increasingly obtained by compound systems with multiple
components,, not just monolithic models.
For example,, Google’s AlphaCode 2 set state-of-the-art results in programming through a
carefully engineered system that uses LLMs to generate up to 1 million possible solutions for a
task and then  lter down the set. AlphaGeometry,, likewise,, combines an LLM with a traditional
symbolic solver to tackle olympiad problems. In enterprises,, our colleagues at Databricks found
that 60% of LLM applications use some form of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),, and
30% use multi-step chains. Even researchers working on traditional language model tasks,, who
used to report results from a single LLM call,, are now reporting results from increasingly
complex inference strategies: Microsoft wrote about a chaining strategy that exceeded GPT-4’s
accuracy on medical exams by 9%,, and Google’s Gemini launch post measured its MMLU
benchmark results using a new CoT@32 inference strategy that calls the model 32 times,, which
raised questions about its comparison to just a single call to GPT-4. This shift to compound
systems opens many interesting design questions,, but it is also exciting,, because it means
leading AI results can be achieved through clever engineering,, not just scaling up training.
In this post,, we analyze the trend toward compound AI systems and what it means for AI
developers. Why are developers building compound systems? Is this paradigm here to stay as
models improve? And what are the emerging tools for developing and optimizing such systems
—an area that has received far less research than model training? We argue that compound AI
systems will likely be the best way to maximize AI results in the future,, and might be one of
the most impactful trends in AI in 2024.",2978aa57548dcf612335b326e2efbb02

https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2024/02/18/compound-ai-systems/ 2/6
Increasingly m any new AI results are from  com pound system s.
Why Use Compound AI Systems?
We de ne a Compound AI System as a system that tackles AI tasks using multiple interacting
components,, including multiple calls to models,, retrievers,, or external tools. In contrast,, an AI
Model is simply a statistical model,, e.g.,, a Transformer that predicts the next token in text.
Even though AI models are continually getting better,, and there is no clear end in sight to their
scaling,, more and more state-of-the-art results are obtained using compound systems. Why is
that? We have seen several distinct reasons:
1. Some tasks are easier to improve via system design. While LLMs appear to follow
remarkable scaling laws that predictably yield better results with more compute,, in many
applications,, scaling o ers lower returns-vs-cost than building a compound system. For
example,, suppose that the current best LLM can solve coding contest problems 30% of the
time,, and tripling its training budget would increase this to 35%; this is still not reliable
enough to win a coding contest! In contrast,, engineering a system that samples from the
model multiple times,, tests each sample,, etc. might increase performance to 80% with
today’s models,, as shown in work like AlphaCode. Even more importantly,, iterating on a
system design is often much faster than waiting for training runs. We believe that in any
high-value application,, developers will want to use every tool available to maximize AI
quality,, so they will use system ideas in addition to scaling. We frequently see this with
LLM users,, where a good LLM creates a compelling but frustratingly unreliable  rst demo,,
and engineering teams then go on to systematically raise quality.
2. Systems can be dynamic. Machine learning models are inherently limited because they are
trained on static datasets,, so their “knowledge” is  xed. Therefore,, developers need to
combine models with other components,, such as search and retrieval,, to incorporate
timely data. In addition,, training lets a model “see” the whole training set,, so more
complex systems are needed to build AI applications with access controls (e.g.,, answer a
user’s questions based only on  les the user has access to).
3. Improving control and trust is easier with systems. Neural network models alone are
hard to control: while training will in uence them,, it is nearly impossible to guarantee that
a model will avoid certain behaviors. Using an AI system instead of a model can help
developers control behavior more tightly,, e.g.,, by  ltering model outputs. Likewise,, even
the best LLMs still hallucinate,, but a system combining,, say,, LLMs with retrieval can
increase user trust by providing citations or automatically verifying facts.
4. Performance goals vary widely. Each AI model has a  xed quality level and cost,, but
applications often need to vary these parameters. In some applications,, such as inline code
suggestions,, the best AI models are too expensive,, so tools like Github Copilot use carefully
tuned smaller models and various search heuristics to provide results. In other
applications,, even the largest models,, like GPT-4,, are too cheap! Many users would be
willing to pay a few dollars for a correct legal opinion,, instead of the few cents it takes to
ask GPT-4,, but a developer would need to design an AI system to utilize this larger budget.
The shift to compound systems in Generative AI also matches the industry trends in other AI
 elds,, such as self-driving cars: most of the state-of-the-art implementations are systems
with multiple specialized components (more discussion here). For these reasons,, we believe
compound AI systems will remain a leading paradigm even as models improve.
Developing Compound AI Systems
While compound AI systems can o er clear bene ts,, the art of designing,, optimizing,, and
operating them is still emerging. On the surface,, an AI system is a combination of traditional",240523610f58653eec750e5713a02c71

https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2024/02/18/compound-ai-systems/ 3/6software and AI models,, but there are many interesting design questions. For example,, should
the overall “control logic” be written in traditional code (e.g.,, Python code that calls an LLM),,
or should it be driven by an AI model (e.g. LLM agents that call external tools)? Likewise,, in a
compound system,, where should a developer invest resources—for example,, in a RAG pipeline,,
is it better to spend more FLOPS on the retriever or the LLM,, or even to call an LLM multiple
times? Finally,, how can we optimize an AI system with discrete components end-to-end to
maximize a metric,, the same way we can train a neural network? In this section,, we detail a few
example AI systems,, then discuss these challenges and recent research on them.

Key Challenges in Compound AI Systems
Compound AI systems pose new challenges in design,, optimization and operation compared to
AI models.
Design Space
The range of possible system designs for a given task is vast. For example,, even in the simple
case of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with a retriever and language model,, there are:
(i) many retrieval and language models to choose from,, (ii) other techniques to improve
retrieval quality,, such as query expansion or reranking models,, and (iii) techniques to improve
the LLM’s generated output (e.g.,, running another LLM to check that the output relates to the
retrieved passages). Developers have to explore this vast space to  nd a good design.
In addition,, developers need to allocate limited resources,, like latency and cost budgets,, among
the system components. For example,, if you want to answer RAG questions in 100 milliseconds,,
should you budget to spend 20 ms on the retriever and 80 on the LLM,, or the other way around?
Optimization
Often in ML,, maximizing the quality of a compound system requires co-optimizing the
components to work well together. For example,, consider a simple RAG application where an
LLM sees a user question,, generates a search query to send to a retriever,, and then generates an
answer. Ideally,, the LLM would be tuned to generate queries that work well for that particular
retriever,, and the retriever would be tuned to prefer answers that work well for that LLM.
In single model development a la PyTorch,, users can easily optimize a model end-to-end
because the whole model is di erentiable. However,, compound AI systems contain non-
di erentiable components like search engines or code interpreters,, and thus require new
methods of optimization. Optimizing these compound AI systems is still a new research area;
for example,, DSPy o ers a general optimizer for pipelines of pretrained LLMs and other
components,, while others systems,, like LaMDA,, Toolformer and AlphaGeometry,, use tool calls
during model training to optimize models for those tools.
Operation
Machine learning operations (MLOps) become more challenging for compound AI systems. For
example,, while it is easy to track success rates for a traditional ML model like a spam classi er,,
how should developers track and debug the performance of an LLM agent for the same task,,
which might use a variable number of “re ection” steps or external API calls to classify a
message? We believe that a new generation of MLOps tools will be developed to tackle these
problems. Interesting problems include:

https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2024/02/18/compound-ai-systems/ 5/6DataOps: Because many AI systems involve data serving components like vector DBs,, and
their behavior depends on the quality of data served,, any focus on operations for these
systems should additionally span data pipelines.
Security: Research has shown that compound AI systems,, such as an LLM chatbot with a
content  lter,, can create unforeseen security risks compared to individual models. New
tools will be required to secure these systems.
Emerging Paradigms
To tackle the challenges of building compound AI systems,, multiple new approaches are arising
in the industry and in research. We highlight a few of the most widely used ones and examples
from our research on tackling these challenges.
Designing AI Systems: Composition Frameworks and Strategies. Many developers are now
using “language model programming” frameworks that let them build applications out of
multiple calls to AI models and other components. These include component libraries like
LangChain and LlamaIndex that developers call from traditional programs,, agent frameworks
like AutoGPT and BabyAGI that let an LLM drive the application,, and tools for controlling LM
outputs,, like Guardrails,, Outlines,, LMQL and SGLang. In parallel,, researchers are developing
numerous new inference strategies to generate better outputs using calls to models and tools,,
such as chain-of-thought,, self-consistency,, WikiChat,, RAG and others.
Automatically Optimizing Quality: DSPy. Coming from academia,, DSPy is the  rst framework
that aims to optimize a system composed of LLM calls and other tools to maximize a target
metric. Users write an application out of calls to LLMs and other tools,, and provide a target
metric such as accuracy on a validation set,, and then DSPy automatically tunes the pipeline by
creating prompt instructions,, few-shot examples,, and other parameter choices for each
module to maximize end-to-end performance. The e ect is similar to end-to-end
optimization of a multi-layer neural network in PyTorch,, except that the modules in DSPy are
not always di erentiable layers. To do that,, DSPy leverages the linguistic abilities of LLMs in a
clean way: to specify each module,, users write a natural language signature,, such as
user_question -> search_query,, where the names of the input and output  elds are
meaningful,, and DSPy automatically turns this into suitable prompts with instructions,, few-
shot examples,, or even weight updates to the underlying language models.
Optimizing Cost: FrugalGPT and AI Gateways. The wide range of AI models and services
available makes it challenging to pick the right one for an application. Moreover,, di erent
models may perform better on di erent inputs. FrugalGPT is a framework to automatically
route inputs to di erent AI model cascades to maximize quality subject to a target budget.
Based on a small set of examples,, it learns a routing strategy that can outperform the best LLM
services by up to 4% at the same cost,, or reduce cost by up to 90% while matching their quality.
FrugalGPT is an example of a broader emerging concept of AI gateways or routers,,
implemented in software like Databricks AI Gateway,, OpenRouter,, and Martian,, to optimize the
performance of each component of an AI application. These systems work even better when an
AI task is broken into smaller modular steps in a compound system,, and the gateway can
optimize routing separately for each step.
Operation: LLMOps and DataOps. AI applications have always required careful monitoring of
both model outputs and data pipelines to run reliably. With compound AI systems,, however,, the
behavior of the system on each input can be considerably more complex,, so it is important to
track all the steps taken by the application and intermediate outputs. Software like LangSmith,,
Phoenix Traces,, and Databricks Inference Tables can track,, visualize and evaluate these outputs
at a  ne granularity,, in some cases also correlating them with data pipeline quality and
downstream metrics. In the research world,, DSPy Assertions seeks to leverage feedback from
monitoring checks directly in AI systems to improve outputs,, and AI-based quality evaluation
methods like MT-Bench,, FAVA and ARES aim to automate quality monitoring.

https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2024/02/18/compound-ai-systems/ 6/6Generative AI has excited every developer by unlocking a wide range of capabilities through
natural language prompting. As developers aim to move beyond demos and maximize the
quality of their AI applications,, however,, they are increasingly turning to compound AI systems
as a natural way to control and enhance the capabilities of LLMs. Figuring out the best practices
for developing compound AI systems is still an open question,, but there are already exciting
approaches to aid with design,, end-to-end optimization,, and operation. We believe that
compound AI systems will remain the best way to maximize the quality and reliability of AI
applications going forward,, and may be one of the most important trends in AI in 2024.
